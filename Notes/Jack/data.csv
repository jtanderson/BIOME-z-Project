However, to what extent the breed affects the rumen microbiome and its association with host feed efficiency is unknown. Here, rumen microbiomes of beef cattle (n = 48) from three breeds (Angus, Charolais, Kinsella composite hybrid) with high and low feed efficiency were explored using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, aiming to identify differences between functional potentials and activities of same rumen microbiomes and to evaluate the effects of host breed and feed efficiency on the rumen microbiome."

"1","Enterotypes of the human gut microbiome","Our knowledge of species and functional composition of the human gut microbiome is rapidly increasing, but it is still based on very few cohorts and little is known about variation across the world. By combining 22 newly sequenced faecal metagenomes of individuals from four countries with previously published data sets, here we identify three robust clusters (referred to as enterotypes hereafter) that are not nation or continent specific. We also confirmed the enterotypes in two published, larger cohorts, indicating that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This indicates further the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis to understand microbial communities. Although individual host properties such as body mass index, age, or gender cannot explain the observed enterotypes, data-driven marker genes or functional modules can be identified for each of these host properties. For example, twelve genes significantly correlate with age and three functional modules with the body mass index, hinting at a diagnostic potential of microbial markers."
"1","A Survey of Culturable Fungal Endophytes From Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa, a Grass From Marine Cliffs, Reveals a Core Microbiome","Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a perennial grass that inhabits sea cliffs of the Atlantic coasts of Europe. In this unhospitable environment plants grow in rock crevices and are exposed to abiotic stress factors such as low nutrient availability, wind, and salinity. Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a host of the fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae, which colonizes aerial organs, but its root mycobiota is unknown. The culturable endophytic mycobiota of FRP roots was surveyed in a set of 105 plants sampled at five populations in marine cliffs from the northern coast of Spain. In total, 135 different fungal taxa were identified, 17 of them occurred in more than 10% of plants and in two or more populations. Seven taxa belonging to Fusarium, Diaporthe, Helotiales, Drechslera, Slopeiomyces and Penicillium appeared to be constituents of the core microbiome of Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa roots because they occurred in more than 20% of the plants analyzed, and at three or more populations. Most fungal strains analyzed (71.8%) were halotolerant. The presence of Epichloë festucae in aboveground tissue was detected in 65.7 % of the plants, but its presence did not seem to significantly affect the structure of the core or other root microbiota, when compared to that of plants free of this endophyte. When plants of the grass Lolium perenne were inoculated with fungal strains obtained from Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa roots, a Diaporthe strain significantly promoted leaf biomass production under normal and saline (200 mM NaCl) watering regimes. These results suggest that the core mycobiome of Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa could have a role in host plant adaptation, and might be useful for the improvement of agricultural grasses."
"1","Talk to your gut: the oral-gut microbiome axis and its immunomodulatory role in the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis","Microbial communities inhabiting the human body, collectively called the microbiome, are critical modulators of immunity. This notion is underpinned by associations between changes in the microbiome and particular autoimmune disorders. Specifically, in rheumatoid arthritis, one of the most frequently occurring autoimmune disorders worldwide, changes in the oral and gut microbiomes have been implicated in the loss of tolerance against self-antigens and in increased inflammatory events promoting the damage of joints. In the present review, we highlight recently gained insights in the roles of microbes in the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we address important immunomodulatory processes, including biofilm formation and neutrophil function, which have been implicated in host-microbe interactions relevant for rheumatoid arthritis. Lastly, we present recent advances in the development and evaluation of emerging microbiome-based therapeutic approaches. Altogether, we conclude that the key to uncovering the etiopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis will lie in the immunomodulatory functions of the oral and gut microbiomes.;"
"1","A Critical Review of the Bacterial Baptism Hypothesis and the Impact of Cesarean Delivery on the Infant Microbiome","Numerous studies suggest that infants delivered by cesarean section are at a greater risk of non-communicable diseases than their vaginal counterparts. In particular, epidemiological studies have linked Cesarean delivery with increased rates of asthma, allergies, autoimmune disorders, and obesity. Mode of delivery has also been associated with differences in the infant microbiome. It has been suggested that these differences are attributable to the “bacterial baptism” of vaginal birth, which is bypassed in cesarean deliveries, and that the abnormal establishment of the early-life microbiome is the mediator of later-life adverse outcomes observed in cesarean delivered infants. This has led to the increasingly popular practice of “vaginal seeding”: the iatrogenic transfer of vaginal microbiota to the neonate to promote establishment of a “normal” infant microbiome. In this review, we summarize and critically appraise the current evidence for a causal association between Cesarean delivery and neonatal dysbiosis. We suggest that, while Cesarean delivery is certainly associated with alterations in the infant microbiome, the lack of exposure to vaginal microbiota is unlikely to be a major contributing factor. Instead, it is likely that indication for Cesarean delivery, intrapartum antibiotic administration, absence of labor, differences in breastfeeding behaviors, maternal obesity, and gestational age are major drivers of the Cesarean delivery microbial phenotype. We, therefore, call into question the rationale for “vaginal seeding” and support calls for the halting of this practice until robust evidence of need, efficacy, and safety is available."
"1","Evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in the gut microbiome within and across hosts","Gut microbiota are shaped by a combination of ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here, we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in approximately 40 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over 6-month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps may be seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.;"
"1","Tongue coating microbiome data distinguish patients with pancreatic head cancer from healthy controls","Background: The microbiota plays a critical role in the process of human carcinogenesis. Pancreatic head carcinoma (PHC)-associated tongue coating microbiome dysbiosis has not yet been clearly defined.Objective: Our aim is to reveal the bacterial composition shifts in the microbiota of the tongue coat of PHC patients.Design: The tongue coating microbiota was analyzed in 30 PHC patients and 25 healthy controls using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology.Results: The microbiome diversity of the tongue coat in PHC patients was significantly increased, as shown by the Shannon, Simpson, inverse Simpson, Obs and incidence-based coverage estimators. Principal component analysis revealed that PHC patients were colonized by remarkably different tongue coating microbiota than healthy controls and liver cancer patients. Linear discriminant analysis effect size revealed that Leptotrichia, Fusobacterium,Rothia, Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, Atopobium, Peptostreptococcus, Catonella, Oribacterium, Filifactor, Campylobacter, Moraxella and Tannerella were overrepresented in the tongue coating of PHC patients, and Haemophilus, Porphyromonas and Paraprevotella were enriched in the tongue coating microbiota of healthy controls. Strikingly, Haemophilus, Porphyromonas, Leptotrichia and Fusobacterium could distinguish PHC patients from healthy subjects, and Streptococcus and SR1 could distinguish PHC patients from liver cancer patients. Conclusions: These findings identified the microbiota dysbiosis of the tongue coat in PHC patients, and provide insight into the association between the human microbiome and pancreatic cancer."

"1","Temporal Variability and Stability of the Fecal Microbiome: The Multiethnic Cohort Study","Background: Measurement reliability and biological stability need to be considered when developing sampling protocols for population-based fecal microbiome studies. \ Methods: Stool samples were collected biannually over a 2-year period and sequenced for the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene in 50 participants from the Multiethnic Cohort Study. We evaluated the temporal stability of the fecal microbiome on a community level with permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), as well as on taxa and diversity measures with intraclass correlation coefficients. \ Results: Interindividual differences were the predominant source of fecal microbiome variation, and variation within individual was driven more by changing abundances than by the complete loss or introduction of taxa. Phyla and diversity measures were reliable over the 2 years. Most genera were stable over time, although those with low abundances tended to be more dynamic. Reliability was lower among participants who used antibiotics, with the greatest difference seen in samples taken within 1 month of reported use. \ Conclusions: The fecal microbiome as a whole is stable over a 2-year period, although certain taxa may exhibit more temporal variability. \ Impact: When designing large epidemiologic studies, a single sample is sufficient to capture the majority of the variation in the fecal microbiome from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, while multiple samples may be needed for rare or less-abundant taxa."

"1","The Human Microbiome: Our Second Genome","The human genome has been referred to as the blueprint of human biology. In this review we consider an essential but largely ignored overlay to that blueprint, the human microbiome, which is composed of those microbes that live in and on our bodies. The human microbiome is a source of genetic diversity, a modifier of disease, an essential component of immunity, and a functional entity that influences metabolism and modulates drug interactions. Characterization and analysis of the human microbiome have been greatly catalyzed by advances in genomic technologies. We discuss how these technologies have shaped this emerging field of study and advanced our understanding of the human microbiome. We also identify future challenges, many of which are common to human genetic studies, and predict that in the future, analyzing genetic variation and risk of human disease will sometimes necessitate the integration of human and microbial genomic data sets."

In particular, experimental manipulations that alter intestinal microbiota impact exploratory and communicative behaviors and cognitive performance. In humans, the first years of life are a dynamic time in gut colonization and brain development, but little is known about the relationship between these two processes. \ Methods \ We tested whether microbial composition at 1 year of age is associated with cognitive outcomes using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and with global and regional brain volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging at 1 and 2 years of age. Fecal samples were collected from 89 typically developing 1-year-olds. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. \ Results \ Cluster analysis identified 3 groups of infants defined by their bacterial composition. Mullen scores at 2 years of age differed significantly between clusters. In addition, higher alpha diversity was associated with lower scores on the overall composite score, visual reception scale, and expressive language scale at 2 years of age. Exploratory analyses of neuroimaging data suggest the gut microbiome has minimal effects on regional brain volumes at 1 and 2 years of age. \ Conclusions \ This is the first study to demonstrate associations between the gut microbiota and cognition in human infants.

Recent advances in through-wall imaging recommend microwaves as a tool with a high potential to noninvasively detect and quantify water throughout buildings.; Methods: Microwaves in both transmission and reflection (radar) modes were used to perform a simple demonstration of the detection of water both on and hidden within building materials.; Results: We used both transmission and reflection modes to detect as little as 1 mL of water between two 7 cm thicknesses of concrete. The reflection mode was also used to detect 1 mL of water on a metal surface. We observed oscillations in transmitted and reflected microwave amplitude as a function of microwave wavelength and water layer thickness, which we attribute to thin-film interference effects.; Conclusions: Improving the detection of water in buildings could help design, maintenance, and remediation become more efficient and effective and perhaps increase the value of microbiome sequence data. Microwave characterization of all forms of water throughout buildings is possible; its practical development would require new collaborations among microwave physicists or engineers, architects, building engineers, remediation practitioners, epidemiologists, and microbiologists.;"

"1","The gut microbiome in anorexia nervosa: relevance for nutritional rehabilitation","Rapidly accumulating evidence supports the important role of gut microbiome in the regulation of mood, behaviour, appetite, gastrointestinal symptomology, and nutrient metabolism. These are all core features frequently altered in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). Current treatment recommendations for AN support the use of high-calorie diets as an essential part of nutritional rehabilitation, commonly achieved by elevating the fat content of the diet. However, in contrast to this approach, there is accumulating evidence suggesting the importance of balanced, high-fibre diets on the gut microbiome. Studies have demonstrated profound differences in the microbial composition of underweight people with AN and those of normal- or overweight individuals. Specific alterations vary widely between studies. It is thus far unclear to what extent the observed differences are brought on by iatrogenic effects of nutritional rehabilitation or the disorder itself. To date, only two studies have investigated the changes in the intestinal microbiota during nutritional rehabilitation and corresponding weight restoration. These studies suggest that the gut microbiome of AN patients was different to healthy controls both prior and following nutritional rehabilitation, though it is noted that these states were associated with lower and higher nutritional intakes, respectively. There is a clear need for further investigation regarding the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on the gut microbiome. Such research would provide insights into the potential role of gut microbiome in modulating the pathophysiology of AN and inform future treatment strategies."

"1","Association of prevalent vaginal microbiome of mother with occurrence of type I diabetes in child","Type I diabetes (T1D) is a rapidly increasing autoimmune disease especially in the Western countries and poses a serious global health problem. Incidence of T1D cannot be fully explained by genetic background, and environmental factors have been assumed to play a role. Environmental conditions and composition of human microbiome have been found to correlate with the incidence of T1D. We asked whether mothers’ prevalent vaginal microbiome could correlate with the incidence of T1D in child. To test this hypothesis, we collected samples of vaginal microbiomes from eight mothers that had at least one child with T1D (child age maximum of 11 years at the time of sampling), born with a vaginal delivery. Eight control mothers had child/children with vaginal delivery and no diabetic child/children. The microbiomes were studied by using 16S rRNA Ion Torrent high throughput sequencing. We found that composition of total and Lactobacillus microbiome was altered, and saw an indication that diversity of vaginal microbiomes of the mothers with a diabetic child could be higher. Based on these pilot observations, we strongly encourage a larger population study to verify whether mother vaginal microbiome diversity and composition are linked to the prevalence of T1D in children."

"1","Childhood asthma hospitalization risk after cesarean delivery in former term and premature infants","Background \ Cesarean delivery modifies infant gut bacterial flora composition, which may result in hindered tolerance to allergenic substances, thereby increasing the risk of asthma in accordance with the hygiene hypothesis. Results of previous studies regarding an association between birth route and asthma are conflicting, and these studies have not evaluated some potential confounding effects, including prematurity and maternal asthma. \ Objective \ To determine whether cesarean delivery in full-term and premature infants increases the risk of subsequent childhood asthma hospitalization. \ Methods \ We conducted a case-control study using the Washington State Birth Events Record Database linked to statewide hospitalization data. The study included 2,028 children hospitalized for asthma (cases) and 8,292 age-matched controls. \ Results \ Cesarean delivery was modestly associated with an increased risk of asthma hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.39). However, when analyzed separately, there was an association between cesarean delivery and asthma hospitalization in premature infants (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.09-3.02) but not in full-term infants (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.97-1.34). \ Conclusions \ Cesarean delivery was associated with subsequent asthma hospitalization only in premature infants. Because mothers with asthma are reported to have increased rates of cesarean delivery and premature delivery, other factors in addition to the hygiene hypothesis, including genetic and in utero influences associated with maternal asthma, may contribute to the increased risk of asthma in premature infants."

"3","Mode of birth and social inequalities in health: The effect of maternal education and access to hospital care on cesarean delivery","Access to health care is an important factor in explaining health inequalities. This study focuses on the issue of access to health care as a driving force behind the social discrepancies in cesarean delivery using data from 707 newborn children in the 2006–2011 birth cohorts of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). Data on individual birth outcomes are linked to hospital data using extracts of the quality assessment reports of nearly all German hospitals. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to assess hospital service clusters within a 20-km radius buffer around mother׳s homes. Logistic regression models adjusting for maternal characteristics indicate that the likelihood to deliver by a cesarean section increases for the least educated women when they face constraints with regard to access to hospital care. No differences between the education groups are observed when access to obstetric care is high, thus a high access to hospital care seems to balance out health inequalities that are related to differences in education. The results emphasize the importance of focusing on unequal access to hospital care in explaining differences in birth outcomes."
"1","Metabolomics and Microbiomes as Potential Tools to Evaluate the Effects of the Mediterranean Diet","The approach to studying diet–health relationships has progressively shifted from individual dietary components to overall dietary patterns that affect the interaction and balance of low-molecular-weight metabolites (metabolome) and host-enteric microbial ecology (microbiome). Even though the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been recognized as a powerful strategy to improve health, the accurate assessment of exposure to the MedDiet has been a major challenge in epidemiological and clinical studies. Interestingly, while the effects of individual dietary components on the metabolome have been described, studies investigating metabolomic profiles in response to overall dietary patterns (including the MedDiet), although limited, have been gaining attention. Similarly, the beneficial effects of the MedDiet on cardiometabolic outcomes may be mediated through gut microbial changes. Accumulating evidence linking food ingestion and enteric microbiome alterations merits the evaluation of the microbiome-mediated effects of the MedDiet on metabolic pathways implicated in disease. In this narrative review, we aimed to summarize the current evidence from observational and clinical trials involving the MedDiet by (1) assessing changes in the metabolome and microbiome for the measurement of diet pattern adherence and (2) assessing health outcomes related to the MedDiet through alterations to human metabolomics and/or the microbiome."
"1","Moderate Renal Impairment and Toxic Metabolites Produced by the Intestinal Microbiome: Dietary Implications","Objective \ Toxic metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiome from animal proteins, carnitine (mainly from red meat), or phosphatidylcholine (mainly from egg yolk), have important adverse effects on cardiovascular disease. These are renally eliminated and may be termed gut-derived uremic toxins (GDUT). We hypothesized that even moderate renal impairment and intake of nutrient precursors would raise plasma levels of GDUT. \ Design \ A cohort study. \ Setting \ Academic medical center. \ Subjects \ Patients attending stroke prevention clinics at a university medical center were recruited. \ Main Outcome Measure \ Nutrient intake was assessed by the 131-item Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was caculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (EPI) equations. Plasma levels of trimethylamine n-oxide, p-cresyl sulfate, hippuric acid, p-cresyl glucuronide, pheny acetyl glutamine, and phenyl sulfate were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. \ Results \ Among 316 patients recruited, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 66.74 (10.42) years; 59.7% were men. Mean eGFR was 76.03 ± 20.01; 57 (18%) had eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma levels of all GDUT were significantly higher even with moderate reduction of eGFR. Nutrient intake affected plasma levels of some GDUT; the effects differed by eGFR above and below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Plasma levels were obtained fasting, so we probably underestimated the effect of nutrient intake. \ Conclusions \ Even moderate impairment of renal function was associated with higher plasma levels of GDUT. This has dietary implications for patients at risk of atherosclerosis, particularly in those with impaired renal function (including the elderly): they should limit intake of animal protein, red meat, and egg yolk. It also points the way to novel approaches to vascular prevention, including more intensive dialysis, renal transplantation, and modification of the intestinal microbiome with probiotics or fecal transplantation."
"1","Planned Out-of-Hospital Birth and Birth Outcomes","Background \ The frequency of planned out-of-hospital birth in the United States has increased in recent years. The value of studies assessing the perinatal risks of planned out-of-hospital birth versus hospital birth has been limited by cases in which transfer to a hospital is required and a birth that was initially planned as an out-of-hospital birth is misclassified as a hospital birth. \  \ Methods \ We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study of all births that occurred in Oregon during 2012 and 2013 using data from newly revised Oregon birth certificates that allowed for the disaggregation of hospital births into the categories of planned in-hospital births and planned out-of-hospital births that took place in the hospital after a woman’s intrapartum transfer to the hospital. We assessed perinatal morbidity and mortality, maternal morbidity, and obstetrical procedures according to the planned birth setting (out of hospital vs. hospital). \  \ Results \ Planned out-of-hospital birth was associated with a higher rate of perinatal death than was planned in-hospital birth (3.9 vs. 1.8 deaths per 1000 deliveries, P = 0.003; odds ratio after adjustment for maternal characteristics and medical conditions, 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 to 4.30; adjusted risk difference, 1.52 deaths per 1000 births; 95% CI, 0.51 to 2.54). The odds for neonatal seizure were higher and the odds for admission to a neonatal intensive care unit lower with planned out-of-hospital births than with planned in-hospital birth. Planned out-of-hospital birth was also strongly associated with unassisted vaginal delivery (93.8%, vs. 71.9% with planned in-hospital births; P<0.001) and with decreased odds for obstetrical procedures. \  \ Conclusions \ Perinatal mortality was higher with planned out-of-hospital birth than with planned in-hospital birth, but the absolute risk of death was low in both settings.

"1","The Gut Microbiome as a Target for IBD Treatment: Are We There Yet?","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to highlight recent research on the gut microbiome in IBD and the application of microbiome-modulating therapies for the treatment of IBD including the use of the microbiome as an indicator for disease severity and treatment response. \ RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the high number of gut microbiome studies and emerging evidence supporting the gut microbiome's involvement in disease pathogenesis, no single microorganism has been identified as a pathogenic agent in IBD. Retrospective studies and meta-analyses on antibiotic use in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and long-term outcomes are conflicting. Similarly, the use of probiotics for the treatment of IBD remains inconclusive; however, some encouraging results are emerging as microbial concoctions are optimized to include beneficial bacterial strains. Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is currently emerging as one of the more promising microbiome-modulating IBD therapies. FMT studies in ulcerative colitis have shown improved remission rates compared to placebo; however, relatively small study sample sizes and varied treatment methods, limit definitive conclusions. With clear evidence of an IBD gut dysbiosis, novel therapies to treat and prevent disease relapse will undoubtedly require a microbiome-modulating approach. The complexity and variability of IBD disease pathogenesis (disease phenotype, gut microbiome, host genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors) will likely require a personalized and multidimensional treatment approach where microbiome-modulating therapy is coupled with other therapies to target other IBD disease components."
"1","Belowground biodiversity and ecosystem functioning","Evidence is mounting that the immense diversity of microorganisms and animals that live belowground contributes significantly to shaping aboveground biodiversity and the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Our understanding of how this belowground biodiversity is distributed, and how it regulates the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, is rapidly growing. Evidence also points to soil biodiversity as having a key role in determining the ecological and evolutionary responses of terrestrial ecosystems to current and future environmental change. Here we review recent progress and propose avenues for further research in this field."
"1","Whole grain-rich diet reduces body weight and systemic low-grade inflammation without inducing major changes of the gut microbiome: a randomised cross-over trial","Objective To investigate whether a whole grain diet alters the gut microbiome and insulin sensitivity, as well as biomarkers of metabolic health and gut functionality. \ Design 60 Danish adults at risk of developing metabolic syndrome were included in a randomised cross-over trial with two 8-week dietary intervention periods comprising whole grain diet and refined grain diet, separated by a washout period of ≥6 weeks. The response to the interventions on the gut microbiome composition and insulin sensitivity as well on measures of glucose and lipid metabolism, gut functionality, inflammatory markers, anthropometry and urine metabolomics were assessed. \ Results 50 participants completed both periods with a whole grain intake of 179±50 g/day and 13±10 g/day in the whole grain and refined grain period, respectively. Compliance was confirmed by a difference in plasma alkylresorcinols (p<0.0001). Compared with refined grain, whole grain did not significantly alter glucose homeostasis and did not induce major changes in the faecal microbiome. Also, breath hydrogen levels, plasma short-chain fatty acids, intestinal integrity and intestinal transit time were not affected. The whole grain diet did, however, compared with the refined grain diet, decrease body weight (p<0.0001), serum inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.009) and C-reactive protein (p=0.003). The reduction in body weight was consistent with a reduction in energy intake, and IL-6 reduction was associated with the amount of whole grain consumed, in particular with intake of rye. \ Conclusion Compared with refined grain diet, whole grain diet did not alter insulin sensitivity and gut microbiome but reduced body weight and systemic low-grade inflammation. \ Trial registration number NCT01731366; Results."
"1","Early colonization of the gut microbiome and its relationship with obesity","Adult and childhood obesity rates are increasing. Childhood obesity, in particular, is a complicated, multifactorial condition that is not always explained by overeating. To address rising rates of obesity, researchers have begun to address how the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome influences metabolism, energy absorption, and weight regulation. Colonization of the gut begins in early life and is highly influenced by method of birth (vaginal versus Caesarean), method of feeding (formula feeding versus breastfeeding), and exposure to antibiotics. Not surprisingly, an infant’s gut microbiome is very likely to resemble that of its mother. However, this means that aberrant bacteria characterized by an obese microbiome can also get passed on from an obese mom to child. To promote the colonization of a healthy infant gut microbiome, the optimal strategy generally is to have a vaginal delivery followed by exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months of age with minimal exposure to antibiotics. However, this is not always possible and overweight or obese mothers risk passing on aberrant bacteria to her children. In such cases, in conjunction with medical professionals, women can consider adding pre- and probiotics to their diets during pregnancy and lactation as well as other mitigation strategies. The colonization of an infant’s gut with optimal bacteria may help reduce the risk of obesity later in life."

"1","The gut microbiome correlates with conspecific aggression in a small population of rescued dogs (Canis familiaris)","Aggression is a serious behavioral disorder in domestic dogs that endangers both dogs and humans. The underlying causes of canine aggression are poorly resolved and require illumination to ensure effective therapy. Recent research links the compositional diversity of the gut microbiome to behavioral and psychological regulation in other mammals, such as mice and humans. Given these observations, we hypothesized that the composition of the canine gut microbiome could associate with aggression. We analyzed fecal microbiome samples collected from a small population of pit bull type dogs seized from a dogfighting organization. This population included 21 dogs that displayed conspecific aggressive behaviors and 10 that did not. Beta-diversity analyses support an association between gut microbiome structure and dog aggression. Additionally, we used a phylogenetic approach to resolve specific clades of gut bacteria that stratify aggressive and non-aggressive dogs, including clades within Lactobacillus, Dorea, Blautia, Turicibacter, and Bacteroides. Several of these taxa have been implicated in modulating mammalian behavior as well as gastrointestinal disease states. Although sample size limits this study, our findings indicate that gut microorganisms are linked to dog aggression and point to an aggression-associated physiological state that interacts with the gut microbiome. These results also indicate that the gut microbiome may be useful for diagnosing aggressive behaviors prior to their manifestation and potentially discerning cryptic etiologies of aggression."

"1","Effect of glyphosate on soil microbial activity and biomass","Herbicides applied to soils potentially affect soil microbial activity. Quantity and frequency of glyphosate application have escalated with the advent of glyphosate-tolerant crops. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of increasing glyphosate application rate on soil microbial biomass and activity. The soil used was Weswood silt loam. The isopropylamine salt of glyphosate was added at rates of 47, 94, 140, and 234 µg ai g−1 soil based on an assumed 2-mm glyphosate–soil interaction depth. Glyphosate significantly stimulated soil microbial activity as measured by C and N mineralization but did not affect soil microbial biomass. Cumulative C mineralization, as well as mineralization rate, increased with increasing glyphosate rate. Strong linear relationships between mineralized C and N and the amount of C and N added as glyphosate (r \ 2 = 0.995, 0.996) and slopes approximating one indicated that glyphosate was the direct cause of the enhanced microbial activity. An increase in C mineralization rate occurred the first day following glyphosate addition and continued for 14 d. Glyphosate appeared to be directly and rapidly degraded by microbes, even at high application rates, without adversely affecting microbial activity."
"3","The need for a new medical model: A challenge for biomedicine","Although it seems that acceptance of the medical model by psychiatry would finally end confusion about its goals, methods, and outcomes, the present article argues that current crises in both psychiatry and medicine as a whole stem from their adherence to a model of disease that is no longer adequate for the work and responsibilities of either field. It is noted that psychiatrists have responded to their crisis by endorsing 2 apparently contradictory positions, one that would exclude psychiatry from the field of medicine and one that would strictly adhere to the medical model and limit the work of psychiatry to behavioral disorders of an organic nature. Characteristics of the dominant biomedical model of disease are identified, and historical origins and limitations of this reductionistic view are examined. A biopsychosocial model is proposed that would encompass all factors related to both illness and patienthood. Implications for teaching and health care delivery are considered.

"1","Quantitative microbiome profiling links gut community variation to microbial load","Current sequencing-based analyses of faecal microbiota quantify microbial taxa and metabolic pathways as fractions of the sample sequence library generated by each analysis1,2. Although these relative approaches permit detection of disease-associated microbiome variation, they are limited in their ability to reveal the interplay between microbiota and host health3,4. Comparative analyses of relative microbiome data cannot provide information about the extent or directionality of changes in taxa abundance or metabolic potential5. If microbial load varies substantially between samples, relative profiling will hamper attempts to link microbiome features to quantitative data such as physiological parameters or metabolite concentrations5,6. Saliently, relative approaches ignore the possibility that altered overall microbiota abundance itself could be a key identifier of a disease-associated ecosystem configuration7. To enable genuine characterization of host–microbiota interactions, microbiome research must exchange ratios for counts4,8,9. Here we build a workflow for the quantitative microbiome profiling of faecal material, through parallelization of amplicon sequencing and flow cytometric enumeration of microbial cells. We observe up to tenfold differences in the microbial loads of healthy individuals and relate this variation to enterotype differentiation. We show how microbial abundances underpin both microbiota variation between individuals and covariation with host phenotype. Quantitative profiling bypasses compositionality effects in the reconstruction of gut microbiota interaction networks and reveals that the taxonomic trade-off between Bacteroides and Prevotella is an artefact of relative microbiome analyses. Finally, we identify microbial load as a key driver of observed microbiota alterations in a cohort of patients with Crohn’s disease10, here associated with a low-cell-count Bacteroides enterotype (as defined through relative profiling)11,12."

"3","Toward a Biopsychosocial Ecology of the Human Microbiome, Brain-Gut Axis, and Health","Objective: Rapidly expanding insights into the human microbiome and health suggest that Western medicine is poised for significant evolution, or perhaps revolution—this while medicine continues on a trajectory from reductionism to a biopsychosocial (BPS) paradigm recognizing biological, psychological, and social influences on health. The apparent sensitivity of the microbiota to perturbations across BPS domains suggests that a broad and inclusive framework is needed to develop applicable knowledge in this emerging area. We outline an ecological framework of the human microbiome by extending the BPS concept to better incorporate environmental and human factors as members of a global, dynamic set of systems that interact over time. Methods: We conducted a selective literature review across disciplines to integrate microbiome research into a BPS framework. Results: The microbiome can be understood in terms of ecological systems encompassing BPS domains at four levels: (a) immediate (molecular, genetic, and neural processes), (b) proximal (physiology, emotion, social integration), (c) intermediate (built environments, behaviors, societal practices), and (d) distal (physical environments, attitudes, and broad cultural, economic, and political factors). The microbiota and host are thus understood in terms of their immediate interactions and the more distal physical and social arenas in which they participate. Conclusions: A BPS ecological paradigm encourages replicable, generalizable, and interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary research and practices that take into account the vast influences on the human microbiome that may otherwise be overlooked or understood out of context. It also underscores the importance of sustainable bioenvironmental, psychological, and social systems that broadly support microbial, neural, and general health."

"1","Plant microbiome-dependent immune enhancing action of Echinacea purpurea is enhanced by soil organic matter content","We previously demonstrated that extracts from Echinacea purpurea material varied substantially in their ability to activate macrophages in vitro and that this variation was due to differences in their content of bacterial components. The purpose of the current study was to identify soil conditions (organic matter, nitrogen, and moisture content) that alter the macrophage activation potential of E. purpurea and determine whether these changes in activity correspond to shifts in the plant-associated microbiome. Increased levels of soil organic matter significantly enhanced macrophage activation exhibited by the root extracts of E. purpurea (p < 0.0001). A change in soil organic matter content from 5.6% to 67.4% led to a 4.2-fold increase in the macrophage activation potential of extracts from E. purpurea. Bacterial communities also differed significantly between root materials cultivated in soils with different levels of organic matter (p < 0.001). These results indicate that the level of soil organic matter is an agricultural factor that can alter the bacterial microbiome, and thereby the activity, of E. purpurea roots. Since ingestion of bacterial preparation (e.g., probiotics) is reported to impact human health, it is likely that the medicinal value of Echinacea is influenced by cultivation conditions that alter its associated bacterial community."
"1","Gut microbiome disruption altered the biotransformation and liver toxicity of arsenic in mice","The mammalian gut microbiome (GM) plays a critical role in xenobiotic biotransformation and can profoundly affect the toxic effects of xenobiotics. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that gut bacteria have the capability to metabolize arsenic (As); however, the specific roles of the gut microbiota in As metabolism in vivo and the toxic effects of As are largely unknown. Here, we administered sodium arsenite to conventionally raised mice (with normal microbiomes) and GM-disrupted mice with antibiotics to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in As biotransformation and its toxicity. We found that the urinary total As levels of GM-disrupted mice were much higher, but the fecal total As levels were lower, than the levels in the conventionally raised mice. In vitro experiments, in which the GM was incubated with As, also demonstrated that the gut bacteria could adsorb or take up As and thus reduce the free As levels in the culture medium. With the disruption of the gut microbiota, arsenic biotransformation was significantly perturbed. Of note, the urinary monomethylarsonic acid/dimethylarsinic acid ratio, a biomarker of arsenic metabolism and toxicity, was markedly increased. Meanwhile, the expression of genes of one-carbon metabolism, including folr2, bhmt, and mthfr, was downregulated, and the liver S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels were significantly decreased in the As-treated GM-disrupted mice only. Moreover, As exposure altered the expression of genes of the p53 signaling pathway, and the expression of multiple genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was also changed in the As-treated GM-disrupted mice only. Collectively, disruption of the GM enhances the effect of As on one-carbon metabolism, which could in turn affect As biotransformation. GM disruption also increases the toxic effects of As and may increase the risk of As-induced HCC in mice."
"1","The Microbiome of an Active Meat Curing Brine","Traditional food products are important to our culture and heritage, and to the continued success of the food industry. Many of the production processes associated with these products have not been subjected to an in-depth microbial compositional analysis. The traditional process of curing meat, both preserves a natural protein source, as well as increasing its organoleptic qualities. One of the most important salting processes is known as Wiltshire curing. The Wiltshire process involves injecting pork with a curing solution and immersing the meat into microbial-rich brine which promotes the development of the distinct organoleptic characteristics. The important microbial component of Wiltshire brine has not been extensively characterized. We analyzed the key microbial component of Wiltshire brine by performing microbiome analysis using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. This analysis identified the genera, Marinilactibacillus, Carnobacterium, Leuconostoc and Vibrio as the core microflora present in Wiltshire curing brine. The important food industrial applications of these bacteria were also assessed. The bacterial diversity of the brine was investigated, and the community composition of the brine was demonstrated to change over time. New knowledge on the characterization of key microbiota associated with a productive Wiltshire brine is an important development linked to promoting enhanced quality and safety of meat processing in the food industry."

"1","Altered Microbiome in Patients With Cirrhosis and Complications","<p>In patients with cirrhosis, the gut microbiome are affected by multiple gut and systemic alterations. These changes lead to dysbiosis in the microbiota of different parts of the body, resulting in inflammation. The constant immune stimulation resulting in part from dysbiosis is associated with morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. Dysbiosis as a dynamic event worsens with decompensation such as with hepatic encephalopathy, infections or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). These microbial patterns could be applied as diagnostic and prognostic measures in cirrhosis in the outpatient and inpatient setting. Current therapies for cirrhosis have differing impacts on gut microbial composition and functionality. Dietary modifications and the oral cavity have emerged as newer targetable factors to modulate the microbiome, which could affect inflammation and, potentially improve outcomes. Additionally, fecal microbial transplant is being increasingly studied to provide compositional and functional modulation of the microbiome. Ultimately, a combination of targeted therapies may be needed to provide an optimal gut milieu to improve outcomes in cirrhosis.</p>"
"1","Diversity of the oral microbiome between dentate and edentulous individuals","BACKGROUND: Measurement of saliva microbes is promoted as a way to detect oral and systemic disease, yet there is a multitude of factors that affect the oral microbiome. The salivary microbiome is influenced by oral biofilm of shedding (epithelial) and non-shedding (tooth) surfaces. \ METHODS: To gauge the ability of salivary microbial analytics to distinguish between edentulous and dentate oral conditions, we looked for differences in the saliva microbiome of subjects with and without teeth. Fifty-two dentate and 49 edentulous subjects provided stimulated saliva samples. 16S rRNA gene sequencing, QIIME-based data processing, and statistical analysis were done using several different analytical approaches to detect differences in the salivary microbiome between the two groups. \ RESULTS: Bacteria diversity was lower in the edentulous group. Remarkably, all 31 of the most significant differences in taxa were deficits that occur in the edentulous group. As one might expect many of these taxa are attributed to dental plaque and gingival sulcus associated bacteria. \ CONCLUSION: In sum, the measurement of 16S rRNA genes in the bacteria of the saliva can be used to reproducibly measure differences in the oral microbiome that occur with edentulism, mainly the lack of tooth and tooth-related structures."
"1","Partial restoration of the microbiota of cesarean-born infants via vaginal microbial transfer","Exposure of newborns to the maternal vaginal microbiotais interrupted with cesarean birthing. Babies delivered by cesarean section (C-section) acquire a microbiota that differs from that of vaginally delivered infants, and C-section delivery has been associated with increased risk for immune and metabolic disorders. Here we conducted a pilot study in which infants delivered by C-section were exposed to maternal vaginal fluids at birth. Similarly to vaginally delivered babies, the gut, oral and skin bacterial communities of these newborns during the first 30 d of life was enriched in vaginal bacteriawhich were underrepresented in unexposed C-sectiondelivered infantsand the microbiome similarity to those of vaginally delivered infants was greater in oral and skin samples than in anal samples. Although the long-term health consequences of restoring the microbiota of C-sectiondelivered infants remain unclear, our results demonstrate that vaginal microbes can be partially restored at birth in C-sectiondelivered babies."
"1","Prevention of surgical site infection via antibiotic administration according to guidelines after gynecological surgery","Aim We modified the antimicrobial prophylaxis of surgical site infection (SSI) according to the guidelines of the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and Japan Society of Infectious Diseases (hereinafter referred to as optimization) and measured outcomes. Methods From April 2016 to March 2017, we performed cesarean section and open hysterectomy with optimization, and compared the outcome to that of surgery performed without optimization between April 2014 and March 2016. We measured the rates of antibiotic discontinuation, appropriate antibiotic selection, SSI incidence, resumption of antibiotic therapy and fever incidence, as well as the length of postoperative hospital stay and medical expenses for antibiotics to evaluate the appropriateness and outcomes of antibiotic prophylaxis. Results Optimization resulted in a change in the method of selecting antibiotics for cesarean section, but there was no change in SSI incidence rate (0.74% vs 0.0%, P = 0.36). Optimization reduced the use of antibiotics and medical expenses of hysterectomy (median reduction of 50% and 78% for hysterectomy without or with lymphadenectomy, respectively). However, there was no change in outcome regarding SSI incidence (5.7% vs 0.0%, P = 0.11 and 7.8% vs 9.5%, P = 0.77, respectively). Conclusion Appropriate use of antibiotics according to guidelines reduced antibiotic dose and medical expenses, but there was no change in outcome regarding SSI incidence rate. These findings suggested that implementation of dosing regimens according to the guidelines would be useful to reduce antibiotic medicine costs and prevent resistant bacteria and complications associated with antibiotics."
"3","An Embodied Neurocomputational Framework for Organically Integrating Biopsychosocial Processes: An Application to the Role of Social Support in Health and Disease","Objective Two distinct perspectives—typically referred to as the biopsychosocial and biomedical models—currently guide clinical practice. Although the role of psychosocial factors in contributing to physical and mental health outcomes is widely recognized, the biomedical model remains dominant. This is due in part to (a) the largely nonmechanistic focus of biopsychosocial research and (b) the lack of specificity it currently offers in guiding clinicians to focus on social, psychological, and/or biological factors in individual cases. In this article, our objective is to provide an evidence-based and theoretically sophisticated mechanistic model capable of organically integrating biopsychosocial processes. \         Methods To construct this model, we provide a narrative review of recent advances in embodied cognition and predictive processing within computational neuroscience, which offer mechanisms for understanding individual differences in social perceptions, visceral responses, health-related behaviors, and their interactions. We also review current evidence for bidirectional influences between social support and health as a detailed illustration of the novel conceptual resources offered by our model. \         Results When integrated, these advances highlight multiple mechanistic causal pathways between psychosocial and biological variables. \         Conclusions By highlighting these pathways, the resulting model has important implications motivating a more psychologically sophisticated, person-specific approach to future research and clinical application in the biopsychosocial domain. It also highlights the potential for quantitative computational modeling and the design of novel interventions. Finally, it should aid in guiding future research in a manner capable of addressing the current criticisms/limitations of the biopsychosocial model and may therefore represent an important step in bridging the gap between it and the biomedical perspective."
"1","The contribution of the gut microbiome to neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric disorders","Bidirectional communication between the gut and brain is well recognized, with data now accruing for a specific role of the gut microbiota in that link, referred to as the microbiome-gut-brain axis. This review will discuss the emerging role of the gut microbiota in brain development and behavior. Animal studies have clearly demonstrated effects of the gut microbiota on gene expression and neurochemical metabolism impacting behavior and performance. Based on these changes, a modulating role of the gut microbiota has been demonstrated for a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and movement including Parkinson's, and importantly for the pediatric population autism. Critical developmental windows that influence early behavioral outcomes have been identified that include both the prenatal environment and early postnatal colonization periods. The clearest data regarding the role of the gut microbiota on neurodevelopment and psychiatric disorders is from animal studies; however, human data have begun to emerge, including an association between early colonization patterns and cognition. The importance of understanding the contribution of the gut microbiota to the development and functioning of the nervous system lies in the potential to intervene using novel microbial-based approaches to treating neurologic conditions. While pathways of communication between the gut and brain are well established, the gut microbiome is a new component of this axis. The way in which organisms that live in the gut influence the central nervous system (CNS) and host behavior is likely to be multifactorial in origin. This includes immunologic, endocrine, and metabolic mechanisms, all of which are pathways used for other microbial-host interactions. Germ-free (GF) mice are an important model system for understanding the impact of gut microbes on development and function of the nervous system. Alternative animal model systems have further clarified the role of the gut microbiota, including antibiotic treatment, fecal transplantation, and selective gut colonization with specific microbial organisms. Recently, researchers have started to examine the human host as well. This review will examine the components of the CNS potentially influenced by the gut microbiota, and the mechanisms mediating these effects. Links between gut microbial colonization patterns and host behavior relevant to a pediatric population will be examined, highlighting important developmental windows in utero or early in development."

This includes immunologic, endocrine, and metabolic mechanisms, all of which are pathways used for other microbial-host interactions. Germ-free (GF) mice are an important model system for understanding the impact of gut microbes on development and function of the nervous system. Alternative animal model systems have further clarified the role of the gut microbiota, including antibiotic treatment, fecal transplantation, and selective gut colonization with specific microbial organisms. Recently, researchers have started to examine the human host as well. This review will examine the components of the CNS potentially influenced by the gut microbiota, and the mechanisms mediating these effects. Links between gut microbial colonization patterns and host behavior relevant to a pediatric population will be examined, highlighting important developmental windows in utero or early in development."

Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago, at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the world’s nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth’s ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper."

"1","A prospective cohort for the investigation of alteration in temporal transcriptional and microbiome trajectories preceding preterm birth: a study protocol","Introduction Preterm birth (PTB) results from heterogeneous influences and is a major contributor to neonatal mortality and morbidity that continues to have adverse effects on infants beyond the neonatal period. This protocol describes the procedures to determine molecular signatures predictive of PTB through high-frequency sampling during pregnancy, at delivery and the postpartum period. \ Methods and analysis Four hundred first trimester pregnant women from either Myanmar or Thailand of either Karen or Burman ethnicity, with a viable, singleton pregnancy will be enrolled in this non-interventional, prospective pregnancy birth cohort study and will be followed through to the postpartum period. Fortnightly finger prick capillary blood sampling will allow the monitoring of genome-wide transcript abundance in whole blood. Collection of stool samples and vaginal swabs each trimester, at delivery and postpartum will allow monitoring of intestinal and vaginal microbial composition. In a nested case–control analysis, perturbations of transcript abundance in capillary blood as well as longitudinal changes of the gut, vaginal and oral microbiome will be compared between mothers giving birth to preterm and matched cases giving birth to term neonates. Placenta tissue of preterm and term neonates will be used to determine bacterial colonisation as well as for the establishment of coding and non-coding RNA profiles. In addition, RNA profiles of circulating, non-coding RNA in cord blood serum will be compared with those of maternal peripheral blood serum at time of delivery. \ Ethics and dissemination This research protocol that aims to detect perturbations in molecular trajectories preceding adverse pregnancy outcomes was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand (Ethics Reference: TMEC 15–062), the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (Ethics Reference: OxTREC: 33–15) and the local Tak Province Community Ethics Advisory Board. The results of this cooperative project will be disseminated in multiple publications staggered over time in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. \ Trial registration number NCT02797327; Pre-results."

Considering scales of interaction beyond the level of the individual host could lead to new insights. Metacommunity theory has many of the tools necessary for modeling multiscale processes and has been successfully applied to host microbiomes. However, the biotic nature of the host requires an expansion of theory to incorporate feedback between the habitat patch (host) and their local (microbial) community. This feedback can have unexpected effects, is predicted to be common, and can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including developmental, ecological, and evolutionary processes.

"1","A Comparison of Homogenization vs. Enzymatic Lysis for Microbiome Profiling in Clinical Endoscopic Biopsy Tissue Samples","Identification of the human microbiome has proven to be of utmost importance with the emerging role of bacteria in various physiological and pathological processes. High throughput sequencing strategies have evolved to assess the composition of the microbiome. To identify possible bias that may exist in the processing of tissue for whole genome sequencing (WGS), it is important to evaluate the extraction method on the overall microbial content and composition. Here we compare two different methods of extraction, homogenization versus enzymatic lysis, on gastric, esophageal and colorectal biopsies and survey the microbial content and composition using WGS and quantitative PCR (qPCR). We examined total bacterial content using universal 16S rDNA qPCR as well as the abundance of three phyla (Actinobacter, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes) and one genus (Fusobacterium). We found minimal differences between the two extraction methods in the overall community structure or in the abundance of specific clade. Furthermore, based on our qPCR analysis, neither method demonstrated preferential extraction of any particular clade of bacteria, nor significantly altered the detection of gram-positive or gram-negative organisms. However, although the overall microbial composition remained the same and the most prevalent bacteria could be detected effectively using either method, we demonstrate that the homogenization extraction method provides higher microbial DNA content and higher read counts from human tissue biopsy samples of the gastrointestinal tract."
"1","The Ocular Microbiome: Molecular Characterisation of a Unique and Low Microbial Environment","AIM: The ocular surface is continually exposed to bacteria from the environment and traditional culture-based microbiological studies have isolated a low diversity of microorganisms from this region. The use of culture-independent methods to define the ocular microbiome, primarily involving 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies, have shown that the microbial communities present on the ocular surface have a greater diversity than previously reported. \ METHOD: A review of the literature on ocular microbiome research in health and disease. \ RESULTS: Molecular techniques have been used to investigate the effect of contact lens wear and disease on the microbiota of the ocular surface and eyelids and the immunoregulatory role of the ocular surface microbiota. Studies have shown that compositional changes in the microbiota occur in ocular surface disorders such as blepharitis, trachoma and dry eye and also suggest a role of the ocular and non-ocular microbiome in retinal disease including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, uveitis and diabetic retinopathy. However, ocular microbiome studies need to recognise the potential for contamination to impact findings and carefully control each stage of the experimental procedure and to utilise statistical methods to identify contamination signals. \ CONCLUSION: The healthy ocular surface is characterised by a relatively stable, comparatively low diversity microbiome with recent findings that the bacteria of the ocular surface appear to have a role in maintaining homeostasis by modulating immune function."
"1","Monocyte-Macrophage activation is associated with NAFLD and liver fibrosis in HIV mono-infection independently of the gut microbiome and bacterial translocation","BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common among people living with HIV. There is limited data available on the pathophysiology of NAFLD and the development of fibrosis in this population. \ OBJECTIVES: to investigate the association of bacterial translocation, adipose tissue dysfunction, monocyte activation and gut dysbiosis in patients with HIV mono-infection and NAFLD. \ METHODS: Cases with biopsy-proven NAFLD and HIV mono-infection were age and sex-matched to HIV+ and HIV- controls. Markers of bacterial translocation (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), bacterial DNA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), adipose tissue dysfunction (leptin, adiponectin) and monocyte activation (sCD14 and sCD163) were measured by ELISA. Hepatic patterns of macrophage activation were explored with immunohistochemistry. 16 s rRNA sequencing was performed with stool. \ RESULTS: Thirty-three cases were included (≥F2 fibrosis n = 16), matched to HIV+ (n = 29) and HIV- (n = 17) controls. Cases with NAFLD were more obese (BMI 31.0 ± 4.4 kg/m vs 24.1 ± 2.8 kg/m p < 0.001) and had significantly increased levels of sCD14, sCD163 and higher leptin to adiponectin ratio versus HIV+ controls. Cases with ≥F2 verses < F2 fibrosis had increased sCD14 (1.4 ± 0.4 vs 1.1 ± 0.3 μg/ml, p = 0.023) and sCD163 (1.0 ± 0.3 vs 0.8 ± 0.3 μg/ml, p = 0.060) which correlated with waist circumference (sCD14 p = 0.022, sCD163 p = 0.011). Immunohistochemistry showed increased hepatic portal macrophage clusters in patients with fibrosis. No markers of bacterial translocation or changes to the microbiome were associated with NAFLD or fibrosis. \ CONCLUSION: NAFLD fibrosis stage in HIV mono-infected patients is associated with monocyte activation in the context of obesity, which may be independent of bacterial translocation and gut microbiome."
"1","Microbiome networks and change-point analysis reveal key community changes associated with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations","Episodes of significant worsening of cystic fibrosis symptoms, known as pulmonary exacerbations (PEs), are associated with oxygen-deficient (anoxic) conditions and increased activity of ‘anaerobic’ bacteria, which thrive in the absence of oxygen. Researchers in Canada, led by David Guttman at the University of Toronto, compared genetic data on microbial populations in sputum samples collected during PEs and at times of better health. The study revealed a strong correlation between the activity and interactions among anaerobic bacteria and the onset of PEs. Investigating the significance of these changes in the lung environment and its microbial populations may help design treatment strategies to reduce the frequency of PEs and their potentially fatal consequences. The authors suggest that antibiotics that specifically target anaerobic bacteria may prove beneficial, as may hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which oxygenates the lung tissue."
"1","Insights into microbiome research 4: The computational analysis","The computational analysis of microbiome samples is a highly specialized task, requiring powerful hardware and deep know-how not only in informatics and statistics but also in ecology and taxonomy. Different approaches must be followed based on the sequencing method (16S or shotgun) and while these can provide partially overlapping information, they are conceptually distinct. Understanding their differences and similarities can be useful in the interpretation of the results of microbiome studies."
"1","The microbiome in patients with atopic dermatitis","As an interface with the environment, the skin is a complex ecosystem colonized by many microorganisms that coexist in an established balance. The cutaneous microbiome inhibits colonization with pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, and is a crucial component for function of the epidermal barrier. Moreover, crosstalk between commensals and the immune system is now recognized because microorganisms can modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Host-commensal interactions also have an effect on the developing immune system in infants and, subsequently, the occurrence of diseases, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD). Later in life, the cutaneous microbiome contributes to the development and course of skin disease. Accordingly, in patients with AD, a decrease in microbiome diversity correlates with disease severity and increased colonization with pathogenic bacteria, such as S aureus. Early clinical studies suggest that topical application of commensal organisms (eg, Staphylococcus hominis or Roseomonas mucosa) reduces AD severity, which supports an important role for commensals in decreasing S aureus colonization in patients with AD. Advancing knowledge of the cutaneous microbiome and its function in modulating the course of skin disorders, such as AD, might result in novel therapeutic strategies."
"1","A unified conceptual framework for prediction and control of microbiomes","Microbiomes impact nearly all systems on Earth, and despite vast differences among systems, we contend that it is possible and highly beneficial to develop a unified conceptual framework for understanding microbiome dynamics that is applicable across systems. The ability to robustly predict and control environmental and human microbiomes would provide impactful opportunities to sustain and improve the health of ecosystems and humans alike. Doing so requires understanding the processes governing microbiome temporal dynamics, which currently presents an enormous challenge. We contend, however, that new opportunities can emerge by placing studies of both environmental and human microbiome temporal dynamics in the context of a unified conceptual framework. Our conceptual framework poses that factors influencing the temporal dynamics of microbiomes can be grouped into three broad categories: biotic and abiotic history, internal dynamics, and external forcing factors. Both environmental and human microbiome science study these factors, but not in a coordinated or consistent way. Here we discuss opportunities for greater crosstalk across these domains, such as leveraging specific ecological concepts from environmental microbiome science to guide optimization of strategies to manipulate human microbiomes towards improved health. To achieve unified understanding, it is necessary to have a common body of theory developed from explicit iteration between models and molecular-based characterization of microbiome dynamics across systems. Only through such model-experiment iteration will we eventually achieve prediction and control across microbiomes that impact ecosystem sustainability and human health."
"1","Bi-directional drug-microbiome interactions of anti-diabetics","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become a global epidemic. Although several drugs are available to manage T2D, problems associated with person-to-person variability in drug efficacy and potential side-effects remain unresolved. Owing to the emerging role of the gut microbiome in obesity and T2D, the interaction between gut microbes and anti-diabetic drugs and its influence on drugs' functions remains of immediate research interest. On one hand, drugs can manipulate gut microbiome composition and metabolic capacity. Conversely, the metabolic activities of the microbiome and its metabolites can also influence drug metabolism and effects. Hence, understanding this bi-directional drug-microbiome interaction and how it influences the clinical outcomes of antidiabetic drugs can pave the way to develop next-generation strategies to ameliorate diabetes. This review presents evidences demonstrating the putative interactions between anti-diabetic drugs and the gut microbiome, and discusses the potential of microbiome modulators to manipulate drug-microbiome interactions and the drug metabolism."
"1","Maternal microbiome and pregnancy outcomes","Alterations of the human microbiome are a known characteristic of various inflammatory disease states and have been linked to spontaneous preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recent advances in metagenomic research have proven that the placenta harbors its own rich diverse microbiome, even in clinically healthy pregnancies, and preterm birth may be a result of hematogenous infection rather than exclusively ascending infection as previously hypothesized. In this review, we describe the microbiome in healthy nongravid and gravid women to contrast it with the alterations of the microbiome associated with spontaneous preterm birth. We also discuss the importance of host gene-environment interactions and the potential for microbiota-specific targeted therapies to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes."

Also, we briefly introduce the relevant challenges that affect the therapeutic efficacy and present the possible solutions."

Metacommunity theory can integrate these local- and regional-scale dynamics to explore symbiont community composition patterns across space. In this article I emphasize that symbionts should be incorporated into the metacommunity concept. I highlight the utility of metacommunity theory by discussing practical and general benefits that emerge from considering symbionts in a metacommunity framework. Specifically, investigating the local and regional drivers of symbiont community and metacommunity structure will lead to a more holistic understanding of symbiont ecology and evolution and could reveal novel insights into the roles of symbiont communities in mediating host health."
"1","Analysis of the relationship between the gut microbiome and dementia: a cross-sectional study conducted in Japan","Dysregulation of the gut microbiome is associated with several life-threatening conditions and thus might represent a useful target for the prevention of dementia. However, the relationship between the gut microbial population and dementia has not yet been fully clarified. We recruited outpatients visiting our memory clinic to participate in this study. Information on patient demographics, risk factors, and activities of daily living was collected, and cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. Fecal samples were obtained, and the gut microbiome was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, one of the most well-established and reliable 16S ribosomal RNA-based methods for classifying gut microbiota. Patients were divided into two groups, demented and non-demented. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the variables independently associated with dementia. The T-RFLP analysis revealed differences in the composition of the gut microbiome: the number of Bacteroides (enterotype I) was lower and the number of ‘other’ bacteria (enterotype III) was higher in demented than non-demented patients. Multivariable analyses showed that the populations of enterotype I and enterotype III bacteria were strongly associated with dementia, independent of the traditional dementia biomarkers. Further studies of the metabolites of gut microbes are needed to determine the mechanism underlying this association."

Of 1,476 identified articles, 11 articles reporting on nine unique studies (all randomized controlled trials) were included. Most studies examined the gut microbiome in infants with colic, while the remaining studies investigated outcomes in children aged 1 day to 18 years at risk for atopic dermatitis or irritable bowel syndrome. Baseline and postintervention gut microbiome differences varied across studies. Findings on psychological functioning also varied, with only half of the captured studies showing a positive effect of intervention on psychological well-being. Only two studies analyzed the association between the gut microbiome and psychological outcomes, each with a different pattern of results. As the field moves forward, it will be critical to gain a better understanding of the microbiome characteristics that influence mental health outcomes in pediatric populations."

"2","Stress and the microbiota–gut–brain axis in visceral pain: Relevance to irritable bowel syndrome","Visceral pain is a global term used to describe pain originating from the internal organs of the body, which affects a significant proportion of the population and is a common feature of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While IBS is multifactorial, with no single etiology to completely explain the disorder, many patients also experience comorbid behavioral disorders, such as anxiety or depression; thus, IBS is described as a disorder of the gut–brain axis. Stress is implicated in the development and exacerbation of visceral pain disorders. Chronic stress can modify central pain circuitry, as well as change motility and permeability throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. More recently, the role of the gut microbiota in the bidirectional communication along the gut–brain axis, and subsequent changes in behavior, has emerged. Thus, stress and the gut microbiota can interact through complementary or opposing factors to influence visceral nociceptive behaviors. This review will highlight the evidence by which stress and the gut microbiota interact in the regulation of visceral nociception. We will focus on the influence of stress on the microbiota and the mechanisms by which microbiota can affect the stress response and behavioral outcomes with an emphasis on visceral pain.

"1","The Effect of Lean-Seafood and Non-Seafood Diets on Fecal Metabolites and Gut Microbiome: Results from a Randomized Crossover Intervention Study","SCOPE: The impact of dietary protein types on the gut microbiome is scarcely studied. The aim of the present study is therefore to examine the effects of lean-seafood and non-seafood proteins on the gut microbiome composition and activity and elucidate potential associations to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. \ METHODS: A crossover intervention study in which 20 healthy subjects consumed two diets that varied in protein source was conducted. 1 H NMR spectroscopy and 16S rDNA sequencing analyses were applied to characterize fecal metabolites and gut microbiota composition, respectively. \ RESULTS: A twofold increase in fecal trimethylamine excretion was observed after the lean-seafood diet period. Circulating TAG and the total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio as well as circulating TMAO levels were each associated with specific gut bacteria. Following the non-seafood diet period, a decreased relative abundance of Clostridium cluster IV and a tendency toward an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio were found. \ CONCLUSIONS: Lean-seafood and non-seafood diets differentially modulate the gut microbiome composition and activity. Furthermore, the gut microbiota composition seems to affect circulating TMAO levels and CVD risk factors."
"1","An integrated approach to evaluate the impacts of the herbicides glyphosate, 2,4-D and metsulfuron-methyl on soil microbial communities in the Pampas region, Argentina","The intensive use of herbicides in agricultural soils of the Pampas region (Argentina) is a matter of environmental concern. We investigated the impacts of three widely used, post-emergence herbicides, glyphosate, 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and metsulfuron-methyl, on soil microbial communities by an integrated approach using short-term soil incubations. The key structural and functional parameters were estimated by culturable aerobic heterotrophic bacterial (AHB) density, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), dehydrogenase activity (DHA), fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, and functional richness. Functional richness was evaluated as the proportion of carbon sources utilized in microplates containing various carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids and aromatic compounds, and 1,3,5-triphenyiltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as redox dye. Three different soil types (Typic Argiudoll, Typic Haplustoll and Petrocalcic Paleustoll) were collected from agricultural fields with reported history of herbicide application. Soil microcosms were treated with one herbicide at a time at a dose 10 times higher than the recommended field application rates (glyphosate, 150mg a.i. kg−1; 2,4-D, 5mg a.i. kg−1; metsulfuron-methyl, 1mg a.i. kg−1soil) and incubated for up to 3 weeks. Metsulfuron-methyl had the least pronounced effects on soil microbial community. 2,4-D showed transient effects on soils, inhibiting either SIR or FDA and stimulating DHA. Several short-term effects of glyphosate on microbial activities and bacterial density were observed: (1) early stimulation of SIR and AHB; (2) dissimilar response in the soils for FDA and DHA; (3) transient increase in functional richness. To conclude, the addition of these herbicides at a dose 10 times higher than the normal field application rates caused minor changes to soil microbial activity, bacterial density and functional richness. The specific changes varied among herbicides, with the effects of glyphosate most pronounced."
"1","Systemic proinflammation after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was correlated to the gut microbiome in HIV-uninfected humans","BACKGROUND: The dysbiosis of gut microbiome and interaction with host immunity after Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection are under-investigation. We had found fatigue symptom concurrent with dysbiosis by decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) in active tuberculosis (TB). The study aims to assess the inflammatory biomarkers and their interaction with gut microbiome in active TB and latent TB infection before starting anti-TB regimens. \ MATERIALS AND METHOD: Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) releasing assay (IGRA) were measured in 25 active TB patients, 32 LTBI subjects, and 23 healthy controls (HC). Gut microbiome profiles were obtained using 16S rRNA MiSeq sequencing method. \ RESULTS: The leukocytosis (7008±383 cell/cum, p<0.05), increase in IL-6 (229.7±104μg/dL, p<0.05), and decrease in IL-4 (0.27μg/dL±0.1, p<0.05) were presented in active TB. The proportion of polymorphic neutrophil (PMN) in peripheral blood was positively related to the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in LTBI and active TB (R2 =0.23, p<0.05). The F/B ratio was positively related to the detectable IL-1B in TB (R2 =0.97, p<0.01) and to the IL-4 in LTBI (R2 =0.27, p<0.05). In LTBI, the relative abundances of Coriobacteriales was positively related to the secretion of IFN-gamma against TB antigens more likely associated with of CD4+ T cell (R2 =0.42, p<0.05). \ CONCLUSION: In active TB, dysbiosis with higher relative abundances of Bacteroidetes in stool and low F/B ratio was related to systemic proinflammation. In LTBI, dose-response relationship between peripheral PMN and relative abundances of Bacteroidetes was remained but not lead to systemic inflammation. This article is protected by copyright.

"1","A finite mixture model for X-chromosome association with an emphasis on microbiome data analysis","Analysis of the X chromosome has been largely neglected in genetic studies mainly because of complex underlying biological mechanisms. On the other hand, the study of human microbiome data (typically over-dispersed counts with an excess of zeros) has generated great interest recently because of advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies. We propose a novel approach to infer the association between host genetic variants in the X-chromosome and microbiome data. The method accounts for random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), skewed (or nonrandom) XCI (XCI-S), and escape of XCI (XCI-E). The inference is performed through a finite mixture model (FMM), in which an indicator variable denoting the “true” biological mechanism is treated as missing data. An expectation-maximization algorithm on zero-inflated and two-part models is implemented to estimate genetic effects. We investigate the performance of the FMM along with strategies that assume XCI and XCI-E mechanisms for all subjects compared with alternative approaches. Briefly, an XCI mechanism codes males’ genotypes as homozygous females, whereas under XCI-E, males are treated as heterozygous females. By comprehensive simulations, we evaluate tests of the hypothesis under a computationally efficient score statistic. In summary, the FMM renders reduced bias and commensurate power compared to XCI, XCI-E, and alternative strategies while maintaining adequate Type 1 error control. The proposed method has far-reaching applications. In particular, we illustrate its usage on a large-scale human microbiome study, the Genetic, Environmental and Microbial (GEM) project, to test for the genetic association on the X chromosome."
"1","The vermiform appendix: an immunological organ sustaining a microbiome inoculum","The hominoid vermiform appendix has been characterized as a diverticulum of the caecum and describes an entity at the juxtaposition of the colon in the confluence of tanias. The independent development of the lymphoid follicle centres of the appendix is progressed at birth in the presence of the intestinal commensal microbiome, an obligatory prompt for the diversification of intestinal and extra-intestinal mucosal immunological tissue. In the vermiform appendix, this activity is centred on further developing the inventory of primary antibodies and the maturation of T- and B-lymphocyte cells in the follicles within the lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, the columnar epithelia, enterocytes and goblet cells comprise the complement of cells that occupy the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae of the vermiform appendix’s mucosa, while macrophages and an abundance of immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G generating plasma cells seed the lamina propria. Intraepithelial immune cells consisting predominantly of specific CD8+ T regulatory lymphocytes occupy sites in the appendix analogous to those present in the intestinal epithelia of the caecal colon. The complement of bacterial genera concealed in the vermiform appendix is posited extant as a biofilm inoculum of the intestinal commensal microbiome. This facilitates re-inoculation of the proximal colon and to a lesser degree the terminal ilium post an intestinal perturbation such as occurs with daily lifestyle stressors, dietary choices and the short-term administration of antibiotics rather than an infectious fulminant colitis. A plausible appreciation results of the importance of multiple immunological aspects of a healthy vermiform appendix and the provision of a commensal biofilm to the gut that repairs a dysbiotic microbiome contributing to balancing intestinal pro- and anti-inflammatory activity for maintaining homeostasis in the gut. Since the composition of the gut microbiome can vary over the short-term and long-term, it is plausible that the appendix inoculum may be instrumental in maintaining the intestinal microbiome."
"3","Food additives, contaminants and other minor components: effects on human gut microbiota—a review","Gut bacteria play an important role in several metabolic processes and human diseases, such as obesity and accompanying co-morbidities, such as fatty liver disease, insulin resistance/diabetes, and cardiovascular events. Among other factors, dietary patterns, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, antibiotics, and non-dietary factors, such as stress, age, exercise, and climatic conditions, can dramatically impact the human gut microbiota equilibrium and diversity. However, the effect of minor food constituents, including food additives and trace contaminants, on human gut microbiota has received less attention. Consequently, the present review aimed to provide an objective perspective of the current knowledge regarding the impacts of minor food constituents on human gut microbiota and consequently, on human health."

"1","The Microbiome and Genitourinary Cancer: A Collaborative Review","Context \ The recent discovery of the existence of a human genitourinary microbiome has led to the investigation of its role in mediating the pathogenesis of genitourinary malignancies, including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, although it is largely recognized that members of the gastrointestinal microbiota are actively involved in drug metabolism, new studies demonstrate additional roles and the potential necessity of the gastrointestinal microbiota in dictating cancer treatment response. \ Objective \ To summarize the current evidence of a mechanistic role for the genitourinary and gastrointestinal microbiome in genitourinary cancer initiation and treatment response. \ Evidence acquisition \ We conducted a literature search up to October 2018. Search terms included microbiome, microbiota, urinary microbiome, bladder cancer, urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and prostate cancer. \ Evidence synthesis \ There is preliminary evidence to implicate the members of the genitourinary microbiota as causative factors or cofactors in genitourinary malignancy. Likewise, the current evidence for gastrointestinal microbes in dictating cancer treatment response is mainly correlative; however, we provide examples where therapeutic agents used for the treatment of genitourinary cancers are affected by the human-associated microbiota, or vice versa. Clinical trials, such as fecal microbiota transplant to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy, are currently underway. \ Conclusions \ The role of the microbiome in genitourinary cancer is an emerging field that merits further studies. Translating microbiome research into clinical action will require incorporation of microbiome surveillance into ongoing and future clinical trials as well as expansion of studies to include metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics. \ Patient summary \ This review covers recent evidence that microbial populations that reside in the genitourinary tract—and were previously not known to exist—may influence the development of genitourinary malignancies including bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers. Furthermore, microbial populations that exist at sites outside of the genitourinary tract, such as those that reside in our gut, may influence cancer development and/or treatment response."
"1","The effect of maxillary sinus antrostomy size on the sinus microbiome","Background The optimal maxillary antrostomy size to surgically treat sinusitis is not well known. In this study, we examined clinical metrics of disease severity and symptom scores, measured secreted inflammatory markers, and characterized the sinus microbiome to determine if there were significant differences in outcome between different maxillary ostial sizes. Methods Prospective randomized, single-blinded clinical trial enrolling 12 individuals diagnosed with recurrent acute or chronic rhinosinusitis. Each patient was blinded and randomized to receive minimal maxillary ostial dilation via balloon sinuplasty on 1 side vs a mega-antrostomy on the contralateral side. Data collected included symptom scores (20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-20]), endoscopy, and radiologic Lund-Mackay scores. During surgery and at their postoperative visit swabs were obtained from each maxillary sinus, and 16S DNA and inflammatory cytokine levels analyzed. The use of each patient as their own control allowed us to minimize confounding variables. Results There was statistically significant improvement in SNOT-20 symptom scores postoperatively in all patients. There were no significant differences between maxillary ostial size in postoperative endoscopy scores, cytokine profile, or bacterial burden. There were statistically significant differences in relative postoperative abundance of Staphylococcus, Lactococcus, and Cyanobacteria between the mega-antrostomy and mini-antrostomy. Conclusions The method used in surgical maxillary antrostomies had no effect on endoscopy scores or cytokine profiles. Microbiome analysis determined significant differences between the different antrostomy sizes in postoperative Staphylococcus, Lactococcus, and Cyanobacteria abundance. The clinical significance of these changes in the sinus microbiome are not known but may be a result of increased access to postoperative sinonasal irrigations."
"3","A meta-analysis of the association between Caesarean section and childhood asthma","Background Children born by Caesarean section have modified intestinal bacterial colonization and consequently may have an increased risk of developing asthma under the hygiene hypothesis. The results of previous studies that have investigated the association between Caesarean section and asthma have been conflicting. Objective To review published literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the evidence in support of an association between children born by Caesarean section and asthma. Methods MEDLINE, Web Science, Google Scholar and PubMed were searched to identify relevant studies. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study from the reported prevalence of asthma in children born by Caesarean section and in control children. Meta-analysis was then used to derive a combined OR and test for heterogeneity in the findings between studies. Results Twenty-three studies were identified. The overall meta-analysis revealed an increase in the risk of asthma in children delivered by Caesarean section (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.14, 1.29). However, in this analysis, there was evidence of heterogeneity (I2=46%) that was statistically significant (P<0.001). Restricting the analysis to childhood studies, this heterogeneity was markedly decreased (I2=32%) and no longer attained statistical significance (P=0.08). In these studies, there was also evidence of an increase (P<0.001) in the risk of asthma after Caesarean section (OR=1.20, 95% CI 1.14, 12.6). Conclusion In this meta-analysis, we found a 20% increase in the subsequent risk of asthma in children who had been delivered by Caesarean section."
"1","Global Consequences of Land Use","Land use has generally been considered a local environmental issue, but it is becoming a force of global importance. Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term."
"1","Omadacycline Gut Microbiome Exposure Does Not Induce Clostridium difficile Proliferation or Toxin Production in a Model That Simulates the Proximal, Medial, and Distal Human Colon","A clinically reflective model of the human colon was used to investigate the effects of the broad-spectrum antibiotic omadacycline on the gut microbiome and the subsequent potential to induce simulated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Triple-stage chemostat gut models were inoculated with pooled human fecal slurry from healthy volunteers (age, ≥60 years)., A clinically reflective model of the human colon was used to investigate the effects of the broad-spectrum antibiotic omadacycline on the gut microbiome and the subsequent potential to induce simulated Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Triple-stage chemostat gut models were inoculated with pooled human fecal slurry from healthy volunteers (age, ≥60 years). Models were challenged twice with 107 CFU C. difficile spores (PCR ribotype 027). Omadacycline effects were assessed in a single gut model. Observations were confirmed in a parallel study with omadacycline and moxifloxacin. Antibiotic instillation was performed once daily for 7 days. The models were observed for 3 weeks postantibiotic challenge. Gut microbiota populations and C. difficile total viable and spore counts were enumerated daily by culture. Cytotoxin titers and antibiotic concentrations were also measured. Gut microbiota populations were stable before antibiotic challenge. Moxifloxacin instillation caused an ∼4 log10 CFU/ml decline in enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis group populations and an ∼3 log10 CFU/ml decline in bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, followed by simulated CDI (vegetative cell proliferation and detectable toxin). In both models, omadacycline instillation decreased populations of bifidobacteria (∼8 log10 CFU/ml), B. fragilis group populations (7 to 8 log10 CFU/ml), lactobacilli (2 to 6 log10 CFU/ml), and enterococci (4 to 6 log10 CFU/ml). Despite these microbial shifts, there was no evidence of C. difficile bacteria germination or toxin production. In contrast to moxifloxacin, omadacycline exposure did not facilitate simulated CDI, suggesting this antibiotic may have a low propensity to induce CDI in the clinical setting."
"1","Serotonin and tryptophan metabolites, autoantibodies and gut microbiome in APECED","Objective \ Intestinal autoimmunity with gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction has been shown in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). Patients lack entero-endocrine (EE) cells and have circulating autoantibodies (Aabs) against critical enzymes in serotonin (5-HT) biosynthesis. \  \ Design \ We sought to determine the serum levels of 5-HT, tryptophan (Trp) metabolites and L-DOPA in 37 Finnish APECED patients and to correlate their abundance with the presence of TPH and AADC Aabs, GI dysfunction and depressive symptoms. We also performed an exploratory analysis of the gut microbiome. \  \ Methods \ Serum 5-HT, L-DOPA and Trp metabolite levels were determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). TPH and AADC Aabs were measured by ELISA. Depression was assessed with a structured RBDI questionnaire. The V3–V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were sequenced for gut microbiome exploration. \  \ Results \ Serum 5-HT levels were significantly decreased (130 ± 131 nmol/L vs 686 ± 233 nmol/L, P < 0.0001) in APECED patients with TPH-1 (±AADC) Aabs compared to controls and patients with only AADC Aabs. Reduced 5-HT levels correlated with constipation. The genus Escherichia/Shigella was overrepresented in the intestinal microbiome. No correlation between serum Trp, 5-HT or l-DOPA levels and the RBDI total score, fatigue or sleep disorders was found. \  \ Conclusions \ This exploratory study found low serum levels of 5-HT to be associated with constipation and the presence of TPH-1 and AADC Aabs, but not with symptoms of depression. Hence, serum 5-HT, TPH1 and AADC Aabs should be determined in APECED patients presenting with GI symptoms."
"1","The Health Advantage of a Vegan Diet: Exploring the Gut Microbiota Connection","This review examines whether there is evidence that a strict vegan diet confers health advantages beyond that of a vegetarian diet or overall healthy eating. Few studies include vegan subjects as a distinct experimental group, yet when vegan diets are directly compared to vegetarian and omnivorous diets, a pattern of protective health benefits emerges. The relatively recent inclusion of vegan diets in studies of gut microbiota and health allows us the opportunity to assess whether the vegan gut microbiota is distinct, and whether the health advantages characteristic of a vegan diet may be partially explained by the associated microbiota profile. The relationship between diet and the intestinal microbial profile appears to follow a continuum, with vegans displaying a gut microbiota most distinct from that of omnivores, but not always significantly different from that of vegetarians. The vegan gut profile appears to be unique in several characteristics, including a reduced abundance of pathobionts and a greater abundance of protective species. Reduced levels of inflammation may be the key feature linking the vegan gut microbiota with protective health effects. However, it is still unclear whether a therapeutic vegan diet can be prescribed to alter the gut microflora for long-term health benefits."
"1","Mode of Delivery – Effects on Gut Microbiota and Humoral Immunity","<i>Background:</i> The rate of caesarean deliveries has increased 10-fold worldwide during the past decades. <i>Objective:</i> To evaluate differences in the establishment of gut microbiota in infants born by vaginal or caesarean delivery and its impact on mucosal immunity. <i>Methods:</i> Altogether, 165 consecutive children, prospectively followed from birth at our clinic in Turku, Finland, were gathered; 141 (85%) were born by vaginal delivery and 24 (15%) by caesarean section. Blood was drawn at physician visits for indirect evaluation of mucosal immunity by ELISPOT assay. Faecal samples were obtained for determination of the gut microbiota by fluorescence in situ hybridization of bacterial cells. <i>Results:</i> Infants delivered by caesarean section harboured fewer bifidobacteria at an early age and were shown to mount a stronger humoral immune response. At 1 month of age, the total gut bacterial cell counts per 1 g faeces were higher in vaginally delivered infants (9.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 95% CI 7.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>–1.2 × 10<sup>10</sup>) as compared to caesarean section delivered (3.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 95% CI 1.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>–8.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>) (p = 0.001). This distinction was mainly due to the greater number of bifidobacteria in vaginally delivered infants (1.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>, 95% CI 6.3 × 10<sup>8</sup>–5.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> vs. 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 95% CI 4.1 × 10<sup>2</sup>–5.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>, respectively) (p = 0.001). During the first year of life, the total number of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-secreting cells was lower (p = 0.03, p = 0.02, p = 0.11, respectively) in infants born by vaginal delivery than in those born by caesarean section, possibly reflecting excessive antigen exposure across the vulnerable gut barrier. <i>Conclusions:</i> Our findings demonstrate that the mode of delivery may have, possibly via gut microbiota development, significant effects on immunological functions in the infant (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00167700)."

"1","Natural immunity: Biodiversity loss and inflammatory diseases are two global megatrends that might be related","We are witnessing two global and deeply worrying trends that, at first glance, seem unrelated. The first trend is the ongoing decline in biodiversity, which is caused by human actions. It could well become the sixth mass extinction of animal and plant species on Earth, comparable in magnitude with the fifth mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago. The second trend is a rapid increase in chronic diseases that are associated with inflammation, especially in developed countries (Fig 1). Inflammation is a key attribute in asthma and allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases and many cancers; even depression has been associated with the presence of inflammatory markers. In this article, we argue that these two phenomena are more closely related than commonly thought: declining biodiversity might actually increase the risk to humanity from chronic diseases and thereby cause a major public health problem. \  \ > We thereby extend the hygiene and microbial deprivation hypotheses to a biodiversity hypothesis, with inevitable consequences for public health \  \  \  \ Figure 1.  \ Two global megatrends in biodiversity and public health. ( A ) Declining biodiversity since 1970 as measured by three indices. LPI, Living Planet Index; WBI, World Bird Index; WPSI, Waterbird Population Status Index (Butchart et al , 2010). ( B ) Increasing trends in the prevalence of inflammatory diseases. Asthma and allergic rhinitis among military conscripts from 1966 to 2003 (Latvala et al , 2005) are shown as an example. \  \  \  \ The underappreciated link between biodiversity and human health are microbes, which inhabit all ecosystems, including the human body. Although microbial life on Earth as such is not threatened—unlike many plant and animal species—the diversity and abundance of microorganisms in affluent urban environments has clearly declined (Alenius et al , 2008), which raises intriguing questions.

"1","SLC39A8 missense variant is associated with Crohn's disease but does not have a major impact on gut microbiome composition in healthy subjects","Background Gene-microbiome interactions are important in aetiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract consisting of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Scarce studies on gene-microbiome interactions show very little overlap in their results. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that gene-microbiome studies are repeated. We aimed to replicate the association between the SLC39A8 [Thr]391 risk allele and gut microbiome composition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy controls. Methods We collected faecal samples, peripheral blood and extensive phenotype data from 291 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 476 healthy controls. Carrier status information was obtained from whole exome sequencing data, generated using the Illumina HiSeq. The gut microbiome composition was determined by tag-sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Associations between carrier status and disease were tested using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. Associations between carriers and gut microbiome composition were determined using principal coordinate analyses, variance explained, alpha diversity and additive general linear models in inflammatory bowel disease, healthy controls and all groups combined. Results Crohn’s disease patients were more often carriers of the missense variant (21/171, 12.3%) than controls (30/476, 6.3%) (OR = 2.1, P = 0.01). We could not identify associations between carrier status and overall gut microbiome composition and microbial richness in all tested groups after correcting for potential confounding factors. We did identify 37 different operational taxonomical units to be associated with carrier status among the tested groups. Two of these 37 were identified before in the discovery study. Conclusions We could confirm the genetic association of the SLC39A8 [Thr]391 risk allele with Crohn’s disease but we could only limited replicate the association in gut microbiome composition. Independent replication of gene-microbiome studies is warranted to identify true biological mechanisms."
"2","Gut microbiome and bone","The gut microbiome is now viewed as a tissue that interacts bidirectionally with the gastrointestinal, immune, endocrine and nervous systems, affecting the cellular responses in numerous organs. Evidence is accumulating of gut microbiome involvement in a growing number of pathophysiological processes, many of which are linked to inflammatory responses. More specifically, data acquired over the last decade point to effects of the gut microbiome on bone mass regulation and on the development of bone diseases (such as osteoporosis) and of inflammatory joint diseases characterized by bone loss. Mice lacking a gut microbiome have bone mass alteration that can be reversed by gut recolonization. Changes in the gut microbiome composition have been reported in mice with estrogen-deficiency osteoporosis and have also been found in a few studies in humans. Probiotic therapy decreases bone loss in estrogen-deficient animals. The effect of the gut microbiome on bone tissue involves complex mechanisms including modulation of CD4+T cell activation, control of osteoclastogenic cytokine production and modifications in hormone levels. This complexity may contribute to explain the discrepancies observed betwwen some studies whose results vary depending on the age, gender, genetic background and treatment duration. Further elucidation of the mechanisms involved is needed. However, the available data hold promise that gut microbiome manipulation may prove of interest in the management of bone diseases."
"1","The impact of human activities and lifestyles on the interlinked microbiota and health of humans and of ecosystems","Plants, animals and humans, are colonized by microorganisms (microbiota) and transiently exposed to countless others. The microbiota affects the development and function of essentially all organ systems, and contributes to adaptation and evolution, while protecting against pathogenic microorganisms and toxins. Genetics and lifestyle factors, including diet, antibiotics and other drugs, and exposure to the natural environment, affect the composition of the microbiota, which influences host health through modulation of interrelated physiological systems. These include immune system development and regulation, metabolic and endocrine pathways, brain function and epigenetic modification of the genome. Importantly, parental microbiotas have transgenerational impacts on the health of progeny. Humans, animals and plants share similar relationships with microbes. Research paradigms from humans and other mammals, amphibians, insects, planktonic crustaceans and plants demonstrate the influence of environmental microbial ecosystems on the microbiota and health of organisms, and indicate links between environmental and internal microbial diversity and good health. Therefore, overlapping compositions, and interconnected roles of microbes in human, animal and plant health should be considered within the broader context of terrestrial and aquatic microbial ecosystems that are challenged by the human lifestyle and by agricultural and industrial activities. Here, we propose research priorities and organizational, educational and administrative measures that will help to identify safe microbe-associated health-promoting modalities and practices. In the spirit of an expanding version of “One health” that includes environmental health and its relation to human cultures and habits (EcoHealth), we urge that the lifestyle-microbiota-human health nexus be taken into account in societal decision making."

"3","The microbiome of the built environment and mental health","The microbiome of the built environment (MoBE) is a relatively new area of study. While some knowledge has been gained regarding impacts of the MoBE on the human microbiome and disease vulnerability, there is little knowledge of the impacts of the MoBE on mental health. Depending on the specific microbial species involved, the transfer of microorganisms from the built environment to occupant’s cutaneous or mucosal membranes has the potential to increase or disrupt immunoregulation and/or exaggerate or suppress inflammation. Preclinical evidence highlighting the influence of the microbiota on systemic inflammation supports the assertion that microorganisms, including those originating from the built environment, have the potential to either increase or decrease the risk of inflammation-induced psychiatric conditions and their symptom severity. With advanced understanding of both the ecology of the built environment, and its influence on the human microbiome, it may be possible to develop bioinformed strategies for management of the built environment to promote mental health. Here we present a brief summary of microbiome research in both areas and highlight two interdependencies including the following: (1) effects of the MoBE on the human microbiome and (2) potential opportunities for manipulation of the MoBE in order to improve mental health. In addition, we propose future research directions including strategies for assessment of changes in the microbiome of common areas of built environments shared by multiple human occupants, and associated cohort-level changes in the mental health of those who spend time in the buildings. Overall, our understanding of the fields of both the MoBE and influence of host-associated microorganisms on mental health are advancing at a rapid pace and, if linked, could offer considerable benefit to health and wellness."
"1","Grape berry surface bacterial microbiome: impact from the varieties and clones in the same vineyard from central China","Aims Bacterial microbiome on grape berry surface may play an important role in grape quality and health. This study aims to investigate the impact of grape varieties and clones on grape berry surface bacterial microbiome from the same vineyard. Methods and Results High-throughput sequencing strategy was used to investigate the bacterial diversity and abundance on the grape surfaces of 12 clones belonging to six varieties grown in the same vineyard of Zhengzhou Fruit Research Institute in Henan Province. In total, 45 bacterial phyla and 933 genera were detected from all samples. Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the most abundant and prevalent phyla, while Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were grape clone specific phyla. The nonrank genus from phylum Cyanobacteria occupied 30–81% of grape clones from Italian Riesling (GRX), Cabernet Franc (PLZ), Pinot Blanc (BBN) and Riesling (LSL). Interestingly, Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Lactococcus were the only three prevalent genera found on all the clones. Furthermore, the predicted functional activities of grape surface bacterial communities varied according to the clones. Conclusions The present study revealed that in addition to the grape varieties, the variations in grape clone background may also affect the bacterial microbiome on grape surfaces which may ultimately determine their functional activities. Significance and Impact of the Study This research provides an important information for grape planting and wine fermentation that not only the grape varieties need to be paid attention but also grape clones from the specific variety need to be concerned."
"1","The Human Mesenteric Lymph Node Microbiome Differentiates Between Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis","Background and Aims \ Mesenteric lymph nodes are sites in which translocated bacteria incite and progress immunological responses. For this reason, understanding the microbiome of mesenteric lymph nodes in inflammatory bowel disease is important. The bacterial profile of Crohn’s disease mesenteric lymph nodes has been analysed using culture-independent methods in only one previous study. This study aimed to investigate the mesenteric lymph node microbiota from both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis patients. \  \ Methods \ Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis patients undergoing resection. Total DNA was extracted from mesenteric lymph nodes and assessed for the presence of bacterial DNA [16S]. All work was completed in a sterile environment using aseptic techniques. Samples positive for 16S DNA underwent next-generation sequencing, and the identity of bacterial phyla and species were determined. \  \ Results \ Crohn’s disease mesenteric lymph nodes had a distinctly different microbial profile to that observed in ulcerative colitis. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was greater in nodes from ulcerative colitis patients, whereas Proteobacteria were more abundant in Crohn’s disease. Although species diversity was reduced in the mesenteric lymph nodes of patients with Crohn’s disease, these lymph nodes contained greater numbers of less dominant phyla, mainly Fusobacteria. \  \ Conclusion \ This study confirms that there are distinct differences between the Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis mesenteric lymph node microbiomes. Such microbial differences could aid in the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, particularly in cases of indeterminate colitis at time of resection, or help explain their mechanisms of development and progression."
"3","Delayed differentiation of vaginal and uterine microbiomes in dairy cows developing postpartum endometritis","Bacterial overgrowth in the uterus is a normal event after parturition. In contrast to the healthy cow, animals unable to control the infection within 21 days after calving develop postpartum endometritis. Studies on the Microbial Ecology of the bovine reproductive tract have focused on either vaginal or uterine microbiomes. This is the first study that compares both microbiomes in the same animals. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism of the 16S rRNA gene showed that despite large differences associated to individuals, a shared community exist in vagina and uterus during the postpartum period. The largest changes associated with development of endometritis were observed at 7 days postpartum, a time when vaginal and uterine microbiomes were most similar. 16S rRNA pyrosequencing of the vaginal microbiome at 7 days postpartum showed at least three different microbiome types that were associated with later development of postpartum endometritis. All three microbiome types featured reduced bacterial diversity. Taken together, the above findings support a scenario where disruption of the compartmentalization of the reproductive tract during parturition results in the dispersal and mixing of the vaginal and uterine microbiomes, which subsequently are subject to differentiation. This differentiation was observed early postpartum in the healthy cow. In contrast, loss of bacterial diversity and dominance of the microbiome by few bacterial taxa were related to a delayed succession at 7DPP in cows that at 21 DPP or later were diagnosed with endometritis.;"
"1","Environment dominates over host genetics in shaping human gut microbiota","Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple factors but the relative contribution of host genetics remains elusive. Here we examine genotype and microbiome data from 1,046 healthy individuals with several distinct ancestral origins who share a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that the gut microbiome is not significantly associated with genetic ancestry, and that host genetics have a minor role in determining microbiome composition. We show that, by contrast, there are significant similarities in the compositions of the microbiomes of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household, and that over 20% of the inter-person microbiome variability is associated with factors related to diet, drugs and anthropometric measurements. We further demonstrate that microbiome data significantly improve the prediction accuracy for many human traits, such as glucose and obesity measures, compared to models that use only host genetic and environmental data. These results suggest that microbiome alterations aimed at improving clinical outcomes may be carried out across diverse genetic backgrounds."

"1","A broken promise: microbiome differential abundance methods do not control the false discovery rate","High-throughput sequencing technologies allow easy characterization of the human microbiome, but the statistical methods to analyze microbiome data are still in their infancy. Differential abundance methods aim at detecting associations between the abundances of bacterial species and subject grouping factors. The results of such methods are important to identify the microbiome as a prognostic or diagnostic biomarker or to demonstrate efficacy of prodrug or antibiotic drugs. Because of a lack of benchmarking studies in the microbiome field, no consensus exists on the performance of the statistical methods. We have compared a large number of popular methods through extensive parametric and nonparametric simulation as well as real data shuffling algorithms. The results are consistent over the different approaches and all point to an alarming excess of false discoveries. This raises great doubts about the reliability of discoveries in past studies and imperils reproducibility of microbiome experiments. To further improve method benchmarking, we introduce a new simulation tool that allows to generate correlated count data following any univariate count distribution; the correlation structure may be inferred from real data. Most simulation studies discard the correlation between species, but our results indicate that this correlation can negatively affect the performance of statistical methods."
"1","Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on environmental microbes and its mechanisms: A review","Before the industrial revolution, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was 180–330 ppm; however, fossil-fuel combustion and forest destruction have led to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. CO2 capture and storage is regarded as a promising strategy to prevent global warming and ocean acidification and to alleviate elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, but the leakage of CO2 from storage system can lead to rapid acidification of the surrounding circumstance, which might cause negative influence on environmental microbes. The effects of elevated CO2 on microbes have been reported extensively, but the review regarding CO2 affecting different environmental microorganisms has never been done previously. Also, the mechanisms of CO2 affecting environmental microorganisms are usually contributed to the change of pH values, while the direct influences of CO2 on microorganisms were often neglected. This paper aimed to provide a systematic review of elevated CO2 affecting environmental microbes and its mechanisms. Firstly, the influences of elevated CO2 and potential leakage of CO2 from storage sites on community structures and diversity of different surrounding environmental microbes were assessed and compared. Secondly, the adverse impacts of CO2 on microbial growth, cell morphology and membranes, bacterial spores, and microbial metabolism were introduced. Then, based on biochemical principles and knowledge of microbiology and molecular biology, the fundamental mechanisms of the influences of carbon dioxide on environmental microbes were discussed from the aspects of enzyme activity, electron generation and transfer, and key gene and protein expressions. Finally, key questions relevant to the environmental effect of CO2 that need to be answered in the future were addressed."
"1","Gut to Brain Dysbiosis: Mechanisms Linking Western Diet Consumption, the Microbiome, and Cognitive Impairment","Consumption of a Western Diet (WD) that is high in saturated fat and added sugars negatively impacts cognitive function, particularly mnemonic processes that rely on the integrity of the hippocampus. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome influences cognitive function via the gut-brain axis, and that WD factors significantly alter the proportions of commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Here we review mechanisms through which consuming a WD negatively impacts neurocognitive function, with a particular focus on recent evidence linking the gut microbiome with dietary- and metabolic-associated hippocampal impairment. We highlight evidence linking gut bacteria to altered intestinal permeability and blood brain barrier integrity, thus making the brain more vulnerable to the influx of deleterious substances from the circulation. WD consumption also increases production of endotoxin by commensal bacteria, which may promote neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction. Recent findings also show that diet-induced alterations in gut microbiota impair peripheral insulin sensitivity, which is associated with hippocampal neuronal derrangements and associated mnemonic deficits. In some cases treatment with specific probiotics or prebiotics can prevent or reverse some of the deleterious impact of WD consumption on neuropsychological outcomes, indicating that targeting the microbiome may be a successful strategy for combating dietary- and metabolic-associated cognitive impairment."

Rates of planned home birth range from 0.1% in Sweden to 20% in the Netherlands, where home birth has always been an integrated part of the maternity system. Benefits of planned home birth include lower rates of maternal morbidity, such as postpartum hemorrhage, and perineal lacerations, and lower rates of interventions such as episiotomy, instrumental vaginal birth, and cesarean birth. Women who have a planned home birth have high rates of satisfaction related to home being a more comfortable environment and feeling more in control of the experience. While maternal outcomes related to planned birth at home have been consistently positive within the literature, reported neonatal outcomes during planned home birth are more variable. While the majority of investigations of planned home birth compared with hospital birth have found no difference in intrapartum fetal deaths, neonatal deaths, low Apgar scores, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, there have been reports in the US, as well as a meta-analysis, that indicated more adverse neonatal outcomes associated with home birth. There are multiple challenges associated with research designs focused on planned home birth, in part because conducting randomized controlled trials is not feasible.

"1","Extensive Unexplored Human Microbiome Diversity Revealed by Over 150,000 Genomes from Metagenomes Spanning Age, Geography, and Lifestyle","The body-wide human microbiome plays a role in health, but its full diversity remains uncharacterized, particularly outside of the gut and in international populations. We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.; Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

"2","The gut microbiome in neurological disorders","Research into the role of the gut microbiome in modulating brain function has rapidly increased over the past 10 years, albeit chiefly in animal models. Increasing clinical and preclinical evidence implicates the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Cross-sectional clinical studies are bolstering the concept of altered microbial composition contributing to the pathophysiology of such diseases. However, the field is nascent, and interpretation of such data is often difficult given that the composition of the microbiome is influenced by various factors such as diet and exercise. Longitudinal studies and randomised controlled trials in humans are needed to find out if targeting the microbiome can yield novel therapeutic strategies. Systems biology approaches will also be important in integrating such data with genomic and metabolomic datasets from clinical cohorts with neurological disease to help guide individual treatment selection."
"1","Exact variance component tests for longitudinal microbiome studies","In metagenomic studies, testing the association between microbiome composition and clinical outcomes translates to testing the nullity of variance components. Motivated by a lung human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) microbiome project, we study longitudinal microbiome data by using variance component models with more than two variance components. Current testing strategies only apply to models with exactly two variance components and when sample sizes are large. Therefore, they are not applicable to longitudinal microbiome studies. In this paper, we propose exact tests (score test, likelihood ratio test, and restricted likelihood ratio test) to (a) test the association of the overall microbiome composition in a longitudinal design and (b) detect the association of one specific microbiome cluster while adjusting for the effects from related clusters. Our approach combines the exact tests for null hypothesis with a single variance component with a strategy of reducing multiple variance components to a single one. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method has a correct type I error rate and superior power compared to existing methods at small sample sizes and weak signals. Finally, we apply our method to a longitudinal pulmonary microbiome study of HIV-infected patients and reveal two interesting genera Prevotella and Veillonella associated with forced vital capacity. Our findings shed light on the impact of the lung microbiome on HIV complexities. The method is implemented in the open-source, high-performance computing language Julia and is freely available at https://github.com/JingZhai63/VCmicrobiome."
"3","Effects of Stress on Commensal Microbes and Immune System Activity","The body harbors a vast array of microbes that are collectively known as the microbiota. Increasing attention is being paid to the role of the gut microbiota in the health of the host. Gut microbial communities are relatively resistant to change, though alterations in homeostasis can also significantly change gut microbial community structure. An important factor that has been demonstrated to alter the composition of the gut microbiota is exposure to psychological stressors. And, evidence indicates that the commensal microbiota are involved in stressor-induced immunomodulation. This chapter will discuss the impact of psychosocial stress on immunity, and present evidence that stressor-induced alterations in the composition of gut microbial communities contributes to stressor-induced immunomodulation and neurobiological sequelae. Finally, the role of the microbiota in the perinatal time period will be explored, and an integrative hypothesis of the role of the microbiome in health and stress response will be proposed.;"
"1","The salivary microbiome of diabetic and non-diabetic adults with periodontal disease","BACKGROUND: A comparison of the salivary microbiome of non-diabetic and diabetic cohorts having periodontal health, gingivitis and periodontitis could reveal microbial signatures unique to each group that will increase understanding of the role of oral microbiota in the pathogenesis of disease, and assist with diagnosis and risk assessment for both periodontal disease and diabetes. \ METHODS: A group of individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) was compared with a group without T2D. For both the diabetic and non-diabetic cohorts, three subgroups were established: periodontal health, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Salivary DNA was extracted (n = 146), polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify 16S rRNA hypervariable region V3-V4, and constructed libraries were sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic and statistical analyses. \ RESULTS: Microbiome analysis resulted in 88 different genus level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for differential abundance testing. Results were largely described by two trends. Trend 1 showed OTUs that increased in abundance with increasing periodontal disease, and in diabetics relative to non-diabetics. Trend 1 OTUs comprised a mix of primarily anaerobic commensals and potential periodontopathogens. Trend 2 was driven primarily by genera that decreased in abundance in those with diabetes relative to those without diabetes, which included other anaerobes associated with periodontal disease. Overall, oral microbial diversity decreased in diabetics and increased with progression of periodontal disease compared with periodontally healthy controls. \ CONCLUSION: Although select microbiota increased in both diabetes and periodontal disease progression, these genera decreased in co-existing diabetes and periodontal disease. These findings suggest that the genera abundance continues to change with additional stress imposed by co-existing conditions."
"1","Bacterial community structure and effects of picornavirus infection on the anterior nares microbiome in early childhood","Background: Little is known regarding the nasal microbiome in early childhood and the impact of respiratory infection on the infants' nasal microbial composition. Here we investigated the temporal dynamics and diversity of the bacterial composition in the anterior nares in children attending daycare centers.; Results: For our investigation, we considered 76 parental-taken nasal swabs of 26 children (aged 13 to 36 months) collected over a study period of 3 months. Overall, there was no significant age-specific effect or seasonal shift in the nasal bacterial community structure. In a sub-sample of 14 healthy children the relative abundance of individual taxa as well as the overall diversity did not reveal relevant changes, indicating a stable community structure over the entire study period. Moreover, the nasal bacterial profiles clustered subject-specific with Bray-Curtis similarities being elevated in intra-subject calculations compared to between-subject calculations. The remaining subset of 12 children provided samples taken during picornavirus infection (PVI) and either before or after a PVI. We detected an association between the relative abundance of members of the genus Streptococcus and PV when comparing both (i) samples taken during PVI with samples out of 14 healthy children and (ii) samples taken during PVI with samples taken after PVI within the same individual. In addition, the diversity was higher during PVI than after infection.; Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a personalized structure of the nasal bacterial community is established already in early childhood and could be detected over a timeframe of 3 months. Studies following infants over a longer time with frequent swab sampling would allow investigating whether certain parameter of the bacterial community, such as the temporal variability, could be related to viral infection.;"

"1","Gut microbiome and brain functional connectivity in infants-a preliminary study focusing on the amygdala","Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the possibility that microbial communities inhabiting the human gut could affect cognitive development and increase risk for mental illness via the 'microbiome-gut-brain axis.' Infancy likely represents a critical period for the establishment of these relationships, as it is the most dynamic stage of postnatal brain development and a key period in the maturation of the microbiome. Indeed, recent reports indicate that characteristics of the infant gut microbiome are associated with both temperament and cognitive performance. The neural circuits underlying these relationships have not yet been delineated. To address this gap, resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 39 1-year-old human infants who had provided fecal samples for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. Measures of alpha diversity were generated and tested for associations with measures of functional connectivity. Primary analyses focused on the amygdala as manipulation of the gut microbiota in animal models alters the structure and neurochemistry of this brain region. Secondary analyses explored functional connectivity of nine canonical resting-state functional networks. Alpha diversity was significantly associated with functional connectivity between the amygdala and thalamus and between the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula. These regions play an important role in processing/responding to threat. Alpha diversity was also associated with functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area (SMA, representing the sensorimotor network) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Importantly, SMA-IPL connectivity also related to cognitive outcomes at 2 years of age, suggesting a potential pathway linking gut microbiome diversity and cognitive outcomes during infancy. These results provide exciting new insights into the gut-brain axis during early human development and should stimulate further studies into whether microbiome-associated changes in brain circuitry influence later risk for psychopathology."

"1","Cultivated Human Vaginal Microbiome Communities Impact Zika and Herpes Simplex Virus Replication in ex vivo Vaginal Mucosal Cultures","The human vaginal microbiome (VMB) is a complex bacterial community that interacts closely with vaginal epithelial cells (VEC) impacting the mucosal phenotype and its responses to pathogenic insults. The VMB and VEC relationship includes nutrient exchange and regulation of signaling molecules that controls numerous host functions and defends against invading pathogens. To better understand infection and replication of sexually transmitted viral pathogens in the human vaginal mucosa we used our ex vivo VEC multilayer culture system. We tested the hypothesis that selected VMB communities could be identified that alter the replication of sexually transmitted viruses consistent with reported clinical associations. Sterile VEC multilayer cultures or those colonized with VMB dominated by specific Lactobacillus spp, or VMB lacking lactobacilli, were infected with Zika virus, (ZIKV) a single stranded RNA virus, or Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV-2), a double stranded DNA virus. The virus was added to the apical surface of the cultured VEC multilayer to model transmission during vaginal intercourse. Viral replication was measured 48h later by qPCR. The results indicated that VEC cultures colonized by VMB containing Staphylococcus spp, previously reported as inflammatory, significantly reduced the quantity of viral genomes produced by ZIKV. HSV-2 titers were decreased by nearly every VMB tested relative to the sterile control, although Lactobacillus spp-dominated VMBs caused the greatest reduction in HSV-2 titer consistent with clinical observations. To explore the mechanism for reduced ZIKV titers, we investigated inflammation created by ZIKV infection, VMB colonization or pre-exposure to selected TLR agonists. Finally, expression levels of human beta defensins 1-3 were quantified in cultures infected by ZIKV and those colonized by VMBs that impacted ZIKV titers. The data presented expands the utility of this ex vivo model system providing controlled and reproducible methods to study the VMB impact on STIs and indicated a correlation between viral replication and specific bacterial species within the VMB."
"1","Investigation of the Skin Microbiome: Swabs vs Biopsies","BACKGROUND: Human skin is populated by diverse bacteria and there is increasing evidence that resident bacteria play a key role initiating immune responses in cutaneous diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa. Bacteria are present at all layers of the skin but many studies have relied on swabs to profile the skin microbiota. As the pathogenesis of many skin conditions is dermal, we wished to compare the microbiota obtained in swabs (surface) and biopsies (dermis). Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing we established the microbial profiles of skin swabs and skin biopsies in sixteen subjects. We found differences in both diversity and taxonomic composition of the microbiome obtained from swabs and biopsies of the same individual. Several taxa were found to be more abundant in the swabs, which displayed significantly higher community richness, but Clostridiales and Bacteroidetes were significantly enriched in the biopsies. The majority of published research on cutaneous microbiota has been based on skin swabs, which represent the surface of the skin. Our study demonstrated a clear difference between the microbiome observed in skin swabs and skin biopsies. These findings may be highly relevant in disorders such as psoriasis where pathogenesis arises in the dermis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"1","Environmental biodiversity, human microbiota, and allergy are interrelated","Rapidly declining biodiversity may be a contributing factor to another global megatrend—the rapidly increasing prevalence of allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases among urban populations worldwide. According to the “biodiversity hypothesis,” reduced contact of people with natural environmental features and biodiversity may adversely affect the human commensal microbiota and its immunomodulatory capacity. Analyzing atopic sensitization (i.e., allergic disposition) in a random sample of adolescents living in a heterogeneous region of 100 × 150 km, we show that environmental biodiversity in the surroundings of the study subjects’ homes influenced the composition of the bacterial classes on their skin. Compared with healthy individuals, atopic individuals had lower environmental biodiversity in the surroundings of their homes and significantly lower generic diversity of gammaproteobacteria on their skin. The functional role of the Gram-negative gammaproteobacteria is supported by in vitro measurements of expression of IL-10, a key anti-inflammatory cytokine in immunologic tolerance, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In healthy, but not in atopic, individuals, IL-10 expression was positively correlated with the abundance of the gammaproteobacterial genus Acinetobacter on the skin. These results raise fundamental questions about the consequences of biodiversity loss for both allergic conditions and public health in general."
"1","Delivery mode shapes the acquisition and structure of the initial microbiota across multiple body habitats in newborns","Upon delivery, the neonate is exposed for the first time to a wide array of microbes from a variety of sources, including maternal bacteria. Although prior studies have suggested that delivery mode shapes the microbiota's establishment and, subsequently, its role in child health, most researchers have focused on specific bacterial taxa or on a single body habitat, the gut. Thus, the initiation stage of human microbiome development remains obscure. The goal of the present study was to obtain a community-wide perspective on the influence of delivery mode and body habitat on the neonate's first microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers’ skin, oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and neonates’ skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were sampled <5 min, and meconium <24 h, after delivery. We found that in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important baseline for studies tracking the human microbiome's successional development in different body habitats following different delivery modes, and their associated effects on infant health."

"1","Engineering root microbiomes for healthier crops and soils using beneficial, environmentally safe bacteria","The Green Revolution developed new crop varieties, which greatly improved food security worldwide. However, the growth of these plants relied heavily on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which have led to an overuse of synthetic fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides with serious environmental consequences and negative effects on human health. Environmentally friendly plant-growth-promoting methods to replace our current reliance on synthetic chemicals and to develop more sustainable agricultural practices to offset the damage caused by many agrochemicals are proposed herein. The increased use of bioinoculants, which consist of microorganisms that establish synergies with target crops and influence production and yield by enhancing plant growth, controlling disease, and providing critical mineral nutrients, is a potential solution. The microorganisms found in bioinoculants are often bacteria or fungi that reside within either external or internal plant microbiomes. However, before they can be used routinely in agriculture, these microbes must be confirmed as nonpathogenic strains that promote plant growth and survival. In this article, besides describing approaches for discovering plant-growth-promoting bacteria in various environments, including phytomicrobiomes and soils, we also discuss methods to evaluate their safety for the environment and for human health."

"1","Impacts of Biodiversity Loss Escalate Through Time as Redundancy Fades","Plant diversity generally promotes biomass production, but how the shape of the response curve changes with time remains unclear. This is a critical knowledge gap because the shape of this relationship indicates the extent to which loss of the first few species will influence biomass production. Using two long-term (≥13 years) biodiversity experiments, we show that the effects of diversity on biomass productivity increased and became less saturating over time. Our analyses suggest that effects of diversity-dependent ecosystem feedbacks and interspecific complementarity accumulate over time, causing high-diversity species combinations that appeared functionally redundant during early years to become more functionally unique through time. Consequently, simplification of diverse ecosystems will likely have greater negative impacts on ecosystem functioning than has been suggested by short-term experiments. \ Long-term grassland experiments show that high-diversity species combinations become more functionally diverse with time. \ Long-term grassland experiments show that high-diversity species combinations become more functionally diverse with time."
"1","Exploring the Human Microbiome: The Potential Future Role of Next-Generation Sequencing in Disease Diagnosis and Treatment","The interaction between the human microbiome and immune system has an effect on several human metabolic functions and impacts our well-being. Additionally, the interaction between humans and microbes can also play a key role in determining the wellness or disease status of the human body. Dysbiosis is related to a plethora of diseases, including skin, inflammatory, metabolic, and neurological disorders. A better understanding of the host-microbe interaction is essential for determining the diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these ailments. The significance of the microbiome on host health has led to the emergence of new therapeutic approaches focused on the prescribed manipulation of the host microbiome, either by removing harmful taxa or reinstating missing beneficial taxa and the functional roles they perform. Culturing large numbers of microbial taxa in the laboratory is problematic at best, if not impossible. Consequently, this makes it very difficult to comprehensively catalogue the individual members comprising a specific microbiome, as well as understanding how microbial communities function and influence host-pathogen interactions. Recent advances in sequencing technologies and computational tools have allowed an increasing number of metagenomic studies to be performed. These studies have provided key insights into the human microbiome and a host of other microbial communities in other environments. In the present review, the role of the microbiome as a therapeutic agent and its significance in human health and disease is discussed. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies for surveying host-microbe interactions are also discussed. Additionally, the correlation between the composition of the microbiome and infectious diseases as described in previously reported studies is covered as well. Lastly, recent advances in state-of-the-art bioinformatics software, workflows, and applications for analysing metagenomic data are summarized."

Selected organic matrices, inorganic nanoparticle (NP) suspensions, and sputter coated metal NPs, as well as various additives, were tested for metabolomics analysis of the turkey gut microbiome. Four NPs and one organic matrix were selected as the optimal matrix set: α-cyano-4-hydroycinnamic acid, Fe3O4 and Au NPs in positive ion mode with 10 mM sodium acetate, and Cu and Ag NPs in negative ion mode with no additive. Using this set of five matrices, over two thousand unique metabolite features were reproducibly detected across intestinal samples from turkeys fed a diet amended with therapeutic or sub-therapeutic antibiotics (200 g/ton or 50 g/ton bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD), respectively), or non-amended feed. Among the thousands of unique features, 56 of them were chemically identified using MALDI-MS/MS, with the help of in-parallel liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis.

"1","The Microbiome Stress Project: Toward a Global Meta-Analysis of Environmental Stressors and Their Effects on Microbial Communities","Microbial community structure is highly sensitive to natural (e.g. drought, temperature, fire) and anthropogenic (e.g. heavy metal exposure, land-use change) stressors. However, despite an immense amount of data generated, systematic, cross-environment analyses of microbiome responses to multiple disturbances are lacking. Here, we present the Microbiome Stress Project, an open-access database of environmental and host-associated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies collected to facilitate cross-study analyses of microbiome responses to stressors. This database will comprise published and unpublished datasets re-processed from the raw sequences into exact sequence variants using our standardized computational pipeline. Our database will provide insight into general response patterns of microbiome diversity, structure, and stability to environmental stressors. It will also enable the identification of cross-study associations between single or multiple stressors and specific microbial clades. Here, we present a proof-of-concept meta-analysis of 606 microbiomes (from nine studies) to assess microbial community responses to: (1) one stressor in one environment: soil warming across a variety of soil types, (2) a range of stressors in one environment: soil microbiome responses to a comprehensive set of stressors (incl. temperature, diesel, antibiotics, land use change, drought, and heavy metals), (3) one stressor across a range of environments: copper exposure effects on soil, sediment, activated-sludge reactors, and gut environments, and (4) the general trends of microbiome stressor responses. Overall, we found that stressor exposure significantly decreases microbiome alpha diversity and increases beta diversity (community dispersion) across a range of environments and stressor types. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between microbial community resistance to stressors (i.e. the average pairwise similarity score between the control and stressed communities) and alpha diversity. We used Phylofactor to identify microbial clades and individual taxa as potential bioindicators of copper contamination across different environments. Using standardized computational and statistical methods, the Microbiome Stress Project will leverage thousands of existing datasets to build a general framework for how microbial communities respond to environmental stress."

"1","Comparison of the oral microbiome of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis and periodontitis-free subjects","Objective \ The primary objectives of the study were to assess differences in complex subgingival bacterial composition between periodontitis-free persons and patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gAgP). \ Background \ The composition of the oral microbiota plays an important role for both oral and systemic diseases. However, the complex nature of the oral microbiome and its homeostasis is still poorly understood. \ Material and methods \ We compared the microbiome of 13 periodontitis-free persons to 13 patients with gAgP. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, targeting the V3/V4 region using the MiSeq platform. \ Results \ In total, 1713 different bacterial species were mapped according to the Greengenes database. Using the Shannon index, no significant differences in alpha diversity were found between the two study groups. In principal component and linear discriminant analyses, disease-specific differences in beta diversity of the microbiome composition were evaluated. Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Synergistetes were more abundant in gAgP whereas Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were associated with a healthy periodontium. At the bacterial species level, we showed that Porphyromonas gingivalis is the strongest indicator of gAgP. Treponema denticola and Tanerella forsythia of the “red complex” as well as Filifactor alocis were among the ten best biomarkers for gAgP. \ Conclusions \ These results broaden our knowledge of disease-specific differences in the microbial community associated with generalized AgP. A more complex view of the composition of the oral microbiome describes the etiology of generalized AgP in more detail. These results could help to individually adapt periodontal therapy in these patients."
"1","Airway microbiome is associated with respiratory functions and responses to ambient particulate matter exposure","Background \ Ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure has been associated with respiratory function decline in epidemiological studies. We hypothesize that a possible underlying mechanism is the perturbation of airway microbiome by PM exposure. \ Methods \ During October 2016–October 2017, on two human cohorts (n = 115 in total) in Shanghai China, we systematically collected three categories of data: (1) respiratory functions, (2) airway microbiome from sputum, and (3) PM2.5 (PM of ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter) level in ambient air. We investigated the impact of PM2.5 on airway microbiome as well as the link between airway microbiome and respiratory functions using linear mixed regression models. \ Results \ The respiratory function of our primary interest includes forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1st second (FEV1). FEV1/FVC, an important respiratory function trait and key diagnosis criterion of COPD, was significantly associated with airway bacteria load (p = 0.0038); and FEV1 was associated with airway microbiome profile (p = 0.013). Further, airway microbiome was significantly influenced by PM2.5 exposure (p = 4.48E-11). \ Conclusions \ To our knowledge, for the first time, we demonstrated the impact of PM2.5 on airway microbiome, and reported the link between airway microbiome and respiratory functions. The results expand our understanding on the scope of PM2.5 exposure's influence on human respiratory system, and point to novel etiological mechanism of PM2.5 exposure induced diseases."
"1","Exploiting the Oral Microbiome to Prevent Tooth Decay: Has Evolution Already Provided the Best Tools?","To compete in the relatively exposed oral cavity, resident microbes must avoid being replaced by newcomers. This selective constraint, coupled with pressure on the host to cultivate a beneficial microbiome, has rendered a commensal oral microbiota that displays colonization resistance, protecting the human host from invasive species, including pathogens. Rapid increases in carbohydrate consumption have disrupted the evolved homeostasis between the oral microbiota and dental health, reflected by the high prevalence of dental caries. Development of novel modalities to prevent caries has been the subject of a breadth of research. This mini review provides highlights of these endeavors and discusses the rationale and pitfalls behind the major avenues of approach. Despite efficacy, fluoride and other broad-spectrum interventions are unlikely to further reduce the incidence of dental caries. The most promising methodologies in development are those that exploit the exclusive nature of the healthy oral microbiome. Probiotics derived from the dental plaque of healthy individuals sharply antagonize cariogenic species, such as Streptococcus mutans. Meanwhile, targeted antimicrobials allow for the killing of specific pathogens, allowing reestablishment of a healthy microbiome, presumably with its protective effects. The oral microbiota manufactures a massive array of small molecules, some of which are correlated with health and are likely to antagonize pathogens. The prohibitive cost associated with sufficiently rigorous clinical trials, and the status of dental caries as a non-life-threatening condition will likely continue to impede the advancement of new therapeutics to market. Nevertheless, there is room for optimism, as it appears evolution may have already provided the best tools."
"1","High-Throughput Sequencing of the 16S rRNA Gene as a Survey to Analyze the Microbiomes of Free-Living Ciliates Paramecium","Ciliates are the largest group of ubiquitous aquatic bacterivorous protists, and many species are easily cultivated. However, only few studies reported prokaryotic communities naturally associated with ciliate cells. Herein, we analyzed the microbiome composition of several strains of Paramecium (Ciliophora) originating from different locations and belonging to two morpho-species by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 16S rRNA gene. Possible reasons of HTS results bias were addressed comparing DNA libraries obtained using different primers and different number of ciliate cells. Microbiomes associated with ciliates and their environments were always significantly different by prokaryotic taxonomic composition and bacterial richness. There were also pronounced differences between Paramecium strains. Interestingly, potentially pathogenic bacteria were revealed in Paramecium microbiomes."

"1","Cross-Domain and Viral Interactions in the Microbiome","The importance of the microbiome to human health is increasingly recognized and has become a major focus of recent research. However, much of the work has focused on a few aspects, particularly the bacterial component of the microbiome, most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract. Yet humans and other animals can be colonized by a wide array of organisms spanning all domains of life, including bacteria and archaea, unicellular eukaryotes such as fungi, multicellular eukaryotes such as helminths, and viruses. As they share the same host niches, they can compete with, synergize with, and antagonize each other, with potential impacts on their host. Here, we discuss these major groups making up the human microbiome, with a focus on how they interact with each other and their multicellular host."

"1","The infant microbiome development: mom matters","The infant microbiome plays an essential role in human health and its assembly is determined by maternal–offspring exchanges of microbiota. This process is affected by several practices, including Cesarean section (C-section), perinatal antibiotics, and formula feeding, that have been linked to increased risks of metabolic and immune diseases. Here we review recent knowledge about the impacts on infant microbiome assembly, discuss preventive and restorative strategies to ameliorate the effects of these impacts, and highlight where research is needed to advance this field and improve the health of future generations."
"1","Birth mode is associated with earliest strain-conferred gut microbiome functions and immunostimulatory potential","The rate of caesarean section delivery (CSD) is increasing worldwide. It remains unclear whether disruption of mother-to-neonate transmission of microbiota through CSD occurs and whether it affects human physiology. Here we perform metagenomic analysis of earliest gut microbial community structures and functions. We identify differences in encoded functions between microbiomes of vaginally delivered (VD) and CSD neonates. Several functional pathways are over-represented in VD neonates, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. We link these enriched functions to individual-specific strains, which are transmitted from mothers to neonates in case of VD. The stimulation of primary human immune cells with LPS isolated from early stool samples of VD neonates results in higher levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin 18 (IL-18). Accordingly, the observed levels of TNF-α and IL-18 in neonatal blood plasma are higher after VD. Taken together, our results support that CSD disrupts mother-to-neonate transmission of specific microbial strains, linked functional repertoires and immune-stimulatory potential during a critical window for neonatal immune system priming."
"1","Effect of the Nursing Mother on the Gut Microbiome of the Offspring During Early Mouse Development","The development of the gut microbiome is influenced by several factors. It is acquired during and after birth and involves both maternal and environmental factors as well as the genetic disposition of the offspring. However, it is unclear if the microbiome development is directly triggered by the mode of delivery and very early contact with the mother or mostly at later stages of initial development mainly by breast milk provided by the mother. To investigate to what extent the gut microbiome composition of the offspring is determined by the nursing mother, providing breast milk, compared to the birth mother during early development, a cross-fostering experiment involving two genetically different mouse lines was developed, being prone to be obese or lean, respectively. The microbiome of the colon was analyzed by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, when the mice were 3 weeks old. The nursing mother affected both α- and β-diversity of the offspring's gut microbiome and shaped its composition. Especially bacterial families directly transferred by breast milk, like Streptococcaceae, or families which are strongly influenced by the quality of the breast milk like Rikenellaceae, showed a strong response. The core microbiome transferred from the obese nursing mother showed a higher robustness in comparison to the microbiome transferred from the lean nursing mother. Overall, the nursing mother impacts the gut microbial composition of the offspring during early development and might play an important role for health and disease of the animals at later stages of life."
